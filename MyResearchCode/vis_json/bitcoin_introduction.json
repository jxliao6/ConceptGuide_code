            "transcript": "  so what is Bitcoin Bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that enables a new way to send payments over the internet you can think of it as an open accounting system where thousands of computers all over the world work together to track ownership of digital tokens called bitcoins when you send someone bitcoins the transaction is broadcast to the entire network after it's verified it's recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain the blockchain contains a record of every Bitcoin transaction that has occurred since the system began and it's shared and maintained on the network so everyone keeps the books so to speak most currencies are issued by a central authority that controls the money supply Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system so there is no central authority instead bitcoins are issued to users who help process transactions in the network this is known as Bitcoin mining Bitcoin miners are specialized computers that do the work required to verify and record transactions in the blockchain as a reward for their work the miners earn bitcoins and this is how new bitcoins are released into circulation the system is programmed so that only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist and as time goes by the mining reward decreases the result is a predictable supply that's governed by scarcity making bitcoins somewhat like a digital gold it's the first currency of the internet and everyone is free to use it with Bitcoin you can send any amount of money to anyone anywhere in the world as easily as sending an email what is Bitcoin bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency bitcoins are digital coins you can send through the internet compared to other alternatives bitcoins have a number of advantages bitcoins are transferred directly from person to person via the net without going through a bank or clearinghouse this means that the fees are much lower you can use them in every country your account cannot be frozen and there are no prerequisites or arbitrary limits let's look at how it works several currency exchanges exist where you can buy and sell bitcoins for dollars euros and more your bitcoins are kept in your digital wallet on your computer or mobile device sending bitcoins is as simple as sending an email and you can purchase anything with Bitcoin the Bitcoin network is secured by individuals called miners miners are rewarded newly generated bitcoins for verifying transactions after transactions are verified they are recorded in a transparent public ledger Bitcoin opens up a whole new platform for innovation the software is completely open source and anyone can review the code bitcoin is changing finance the same way the web changed publishing when everyone has access to a global market great ideas flourish bitcoins are a great way for businesses to minimize transaction fees it doesn't cost anything to start accepting them and it's easy to set up there are no chargebacks and you'll get additional business from the Bitcoin economy for more information about Bitcoin visit we use coins calm",

            "transcript": "  hello and welcome to building and automated cryptocurrency trading BOTS we will be using Python on the Finance Exchange my name is blockchain engineer you can find me on at blockchain Eng on Twitter and medium.com first off a little bit of an introduction to crypto currencies a crypto currency is a cryptographic cryptographically signed store of asset asset or store value similar to ecash or digital cash bitcoin is a crypto currency it is one of the most popular with a current market price of over eight thousand dollars a blockchain is a technological advance of triple ledger where transactions are recorded on the block and these blocks are connected to one another which provides a great way of recording transactions and ownership of a particular asset such as a cryptocurrency you can purchase bitcoins or cryptocurrency through exchanges or primarily through a website such as coin based comm which you can provide your credit card or debit card or there are other ways to purchase crypto currencies such as a wire transfer that type of thing you can also meet in person to purchase crypto currencies finance is a particular exchange there are many exchanges but finance is one of the largest and has one of the lowest transaction fees which is why it is being used as the exchange in this trading tutorial and it has many cryptocurrencies listed and you can exchange one for another such as Bitcoin for aetherium or pot coin or any type of other coin my goals for this project is to create a algorithm or software script which will buy and sell crypto currencies automatically so that way you never or theoretically hopefully you are holding on to a cryptocurrency as the price declines this is to met the ultimate goal is to manage a portfolio your portfolio of cash or crypto currencies so that way the profit is always going up and we will do this by tracking price histories and technical analysis signals for different cryptocurrencies a good introduction to trading cryptocurrencies on Finance and a basic strategy that we will be implementing through this project is available from Tony Ivanov I will post a link to this video in the comments and it just shows a pretty good description of how the project works additionally these are some more reading materials available to learn more about trading cryptocurrencies there are quite a lot of very valuable information on YouTube already such as cent Dex and Dena REO research these have some very good videos so I put a link to these a little bit about this we will go chapter by chapter up to seven chapters basically explaining how this crypto currency trading bot works the functionality the software and how to ultimately get it set up as well as the ideas behind it so the first thing to do is install pycharm which is a Python interactive development if it is very helpful to use in the development of this and you can also deploy it there's many tutorials on how to set it up and using it so I will leave those up to you to find out on the right hand side is the libraries that we will be using so you need to have these installed again one of the main reasons for using PyCharm is the ease of install you can also use pip we will be using a wonderful finance wrapper called Python by Nantz which provides a lot of the functionality that our trader will be using such as buying selling and retrieving the data historical data I will post a link to this so here's just a few examples of the different functions that are used by the trading bot and how to call them such as getting the withdrawal history the trade history current prices current list of symbols the additionally market depth I have modified this to be able to display the order book which is the number of buy and sell orders which are currently at this at the second that it's called listed also the coin prices and coin tickers now a large part of this bot is to analyze the historical data for different coins so the price prices over time how they went up or down now the main functionality behind this bot is involved using Bollinger Bands and stochastic RSI to determine our buy and sell signals not only will we be and that is a type of swing trading and we'll be automating it using different positions and different size positions we'll be using crypto signals for our technical analysis buy and sell signals and you can see it has a different statistics available such as moving averages and Bollinger Bands a little bit more of the description is not only are we gonna be buying and selling given the right Bollinger Band and RSI signals but that's going to be dollar cost average so that way we don't have to time it exactly at the bottom and exactly at the top but hopefully it will remake a return additionally we're going to be using this bot for a crypto currency coin index which is a idea that I've wanted to implement for a while similar to the Dow Jones Industrial Average so that way we can see how things are going up or down according to the market now the of course the bots going to be keeping a profit or loss statements that way we can learn how well it's doing and evaluated and see what different types of tweaks need to be done eventually this will be emailed or shared via social channels now again as I said collecting the historic data is a very important part of this bot and it's how we will know if things are in the uptrend or downtrend and that will inform our buy or sell signals we will also be comparing the index that we described previously based upon a simple number of coins to the different strategies we implemented because it doesn't help to know oh and up exit went down why we'd like to know versus a general market trend now ultimately there's going to be built out much more functionality including short medium long term time horizons and incorporating other types of data such as GDP world population so that way it'll be the most informed as possible to incorporate different signals and buy and sell signals ultimately this is going to work with the different bots so that way you can buy or sell or manage your portfolio directly from discord or Twitter if you'd like and this can be implemented as a group by ourselves strategy portfolios get data have your data visualized believe they'll be very helpful for different groups and add functionality could ultimately each yield some interesting projects so in conclusion I've described a web bot algorithmic trading bot that I've developed and how it will be useful for trading cryptocurrency to hopefully increase your return on investment there is a definitely future developments required incorporate such as incorporating the more trade signals and statistics with the bots incorporating social media and providing a large variety of visualizations of not only the bots in action but some of the data you may be curious about of your favorite coins for different time horizons if you'd like to follow the project further follow us on Twitter and",

            "transcript": "  I'm going to talk to you about the digital currency Bitcoin in this presentation I will refer to Bitcoin in two ways first there is Bitcoin the unit as a unit you can think of one Bitcoin as something similar to $1.00 second you have Bitcoin the system the Bitcoin system is the underlying mechanism that defines how Bitcoin actually works Bitcoin is growing really quickly and it has the potential to change the way all of us use money here are some of the companies and groups that already accept Bitcoin they include overstock the rapper 50 cent the Sacramento Kings and many more this presentation has two parts first I'm going to describe what bit Glynn is and why it's special by walking through three of its defining features second I'm going to explain how Bitcoin actually works rather than explain the entire system as it currently exists I'm going to work with you to build our own implementation of Bitcoin from scratch by recreating Bitcoin in this presentation we will learn why bitcoin is structured the way it is today alright let's begin bitcoin is often described as a digital currency but we already have digital currencies most banks allow for online transactions and PayPal has been around for over a decade now what makes Bitcoin special here are three of bitcoins defining features first Bitcoin allows for instantaneous transactions with anyone in the world for fractions of a penny before Bitcoin if I wanted to send money to someone I would need a bank account the other person would need a bank account and one of us would have to pay a significant transaction fee if I wanted to send a large amount of money or if one of us was in a part of the world with an unstable currency the transaction would take much longer and the fee would be much larger with Bitcoin I can send money to anyone in the world instantaneously for fractions of a penny and all I need is a piece of software and an internet connection second Bitcoin introduces genuine scarcity into the digital realm unlike physical goods like gold digital resources are not inherently limited in their supply many attempts have been made to enforce a limited supply of digital resources iTunes is one attempt that has largely failed given past failures it is incredible that Bitcoin has succeeded in limiting the supply of the digital resource without a central authority finally fit coin prevents fraud and theft without a central planner currently we have to trust central bank's would-be integrity of our currencies these systems are inherently trust based if the Federal Reserve Chairman makes a bad decision we all have to face the consequences bitcoin is trustless and that means that the rule is encoded in the software are enforced without trust in anyone let alone a central organization now let's talk about how Bitcoin works as I mentioned before we're going to recreate Bitcoin from scratch it's very important that our version of Bitcoin like the actual version has the three defining features I just explained our initial implementation will have many flaws but by improving on that first implementation we will gain a deeper understanding of why Bitcoin is structured the way it is today here's version 1 in this version if Alice wants to send a Bitcoin to Bob she should write and sign this message I Alice I'm giving Bob one Bitcoin in Bitcoin each of these messages represents a transaction by making Alice sign each transaction we're solving a problem Alice's signature ensures that she can't turn around and deny sending the Bitcoin next Alice should send the transaction to everyone running the Bitcoin software now everyone knows that Bob has one more Bitcoin and Alice has one less this first version has one major flaw Alice could keep sending the same transaction five times what would that mean does Bob now have five different bitcoins or five duplicates of the same Bitcoin this is a problem version two needs to solve conversion to we're going to solve that problem of double spending by introducing serial numbers to make bitcoins uniquely identifiable now if should send the message I Alice I'm giving Bob one Bitcoin with serial number 873 - this way Alice can only spend each Bitcoin once there is a problem where would these serial numbers come from and how do we manage who owns which Bitcoin with serial numbers Bob can make sure that Alice does send him the same Bitcoin twice but how can he be sure that the Bitcoin belonged to her in the first place to make version to work there needs to be a trusted source of serial numbers the traditional source is a bank this Bank would provide serial numbers for bitcoins keep track of who owns which bitcoins and verify that transactions are legitimate now when Alice sends her transaction to Bob he can check with the bank that the Bitcoin actually belonged to her and that it is unique there is a problem version 2 did solve the issue of duplication but it lost the decentralized nature of version 1 where transactions were announced to everyone without a bank version 3 should bring that decentralized structure back in version 3 we're going to bring back that decentralized structure by making everyone the bank now everyone has a complete record of all Bitcoin transactions will call this record the blockchain since that's what it's called in the Bitcoin software now when Ellis check his copy of the blockchain to be sure that the Bitcoin actually belonged to Alice if that works out bob announces the transaction to the world and everyone updates their copy of the blockchain there is a problem what if Alice sends her transaction to Bob and Charlie simultaneously both will find that the Bitcoin belonged to Alice except the transaction and announce it to the world how should other people update their copies of the blockchain obviously both Bob and Charlie can't on the same Bitcoin so we have a problem version 4 should solve that we can begin in version 4 by giving everyone the power to verify transaction now when Alice sends her transaction to Bob Bob shouldn't try to verify the transaction alone rather he should broadcast the possible transaction to the entire network of Bitcoin users and ask them to help verify it if enough users verify the transaction Bob can accept the Bitcoin and everyone will update their blockchain this way if Alice tries to double spend on Bob and Charlie other Bitcoin users will notice and reject the transactions there's a problem with this approach alice could double spend on Bob and Charlie by taking over the big network if Alice is clever she can use an automated system to set up a large number of separate identities that overwhelm the Bitcoin network now when Bob and Charlie asked the network to verify their transactions Alice's many identities swamped the network and announced to both Bob and Charlie that the transactions are fine fooling them into accepting the same bitcoind version five really needs to solve this issue of double spending once and for all we can solve the issue of double spending in version 5 by implementing something called proof of work in a proof of work system when Alice wants to give Bob some Bitcoin she announces her transaction as a message to the entire network as other users receive Alice's transaction message they add it to a list of pending transactions they've been told about but haven't yet been verified by the network for instance another user named David might have this list of pending transactions if David wants to verify these pending transactions in a proof-of-work system he has to do three things first David has to check his copy of the blockchain to make sure the transactions are legitimate second his computer has to use resources to solve a hard mathematical puzzle and third he has to announce the block of transactions to the network before we take a closer look remember that if David doesn't want to verify any he doesn't have to you can just let other users do that you might be wondering why does David's computer have to solve a math puzzle this is an important question by requiring David's computer to solve a math puzzle we are actually solving the problem of double spending let's take a look at that problem again by setting up a large number of separate identities on the Bitcoin network Alice can double spend on Bob and Charlie we want to make it costly for Alice to double spend but it's difficult to identify dishonest actors before they act so we will simply make it costly for anyone to verify transactions in the Bitcoin system that cost is called proof of work and it involves a math puzzle you can think of proof of work as a competition to verify transactions if your computer solves the math puzzle before the other computers on the network you will verify the pending transactions and receive some Bitcoin as a reward proof-of-work prevents bad people like Alice from double spending because it puts them in competition with everyone else trying to verify transactions so long as most of the computing power on the network is controlled by honest people bad people like Alice will have a hard time doing dishonest things like double spending and that's it we've recreated Bitcoin here's a table of the versions we went through their most important features and the value they brought to the final system hopefully now you have a better idea of how Bitcoin works and why it's so special thanks for watching",

            "transcript": "  hi and welcome this is the first in a series of bonus lectures I've decided to create to cover a couple of extra topics that I think will give you a better understanding of how the Bitcoin works these lectures are optional and in this course is self-contained meaning you'll have a pretty good idea of what the Bitcoin is all about without the however these lectures are meant to elaborate a little bit more deeply on certain topics this lecture is on cryptography and I'm going to explain the fundamentals of cryptography and we're gonna kind of work our way towards the cryptographic protocol that the Bitcoin uses okay so cryptography in general can usually be explained in terms of two people talking to each other this is the quintessential example we tend to use the Alice and Bob so let's say that you're Bob and I'm gonna give you a key because Bob is an awesome guy okay so Bob here we go and let's say Bob has a girlfriend and her name is Alice you can see that I didn't go to art school alright so here is Alice okay and Bob wants to go ahead and communicate with Alice securely they want to send messages back and forth to each other well here's the issue let's say Bob has a girlfriend an ex-girlfriend her name is Eve and they dated for a while it was fun unfortunately Eve is utterly crazy and so obviously Bob no longer wishes to associate himself with Eve Bob doesn't want to do anything but he still thinks that they're together and any message that Bob sends to Alice to-and-fro Eve will intercept because she's very talented and if she sees something like I love you this will draw even to a mad rage and she'll go and kill Alice and Bob doesn't want that to happen so we obviously need a way of securely communicating so in general how we think about secure communication as we tend to think about it in terms of either a shared key there we go a shared key or a public/private key okay so let's begin with the share key under the shared key case Bob here and Alice what they do is they meet up at the park take you somewhere and they decide on a secret key K okay so we'll write secret right here and what Bob does is he takes a cryptographic function can be very many and he takes this message he wants to tell Alice and he uses that secret key and it outputs a cryptographically secure message so let's say Eve intercepts it because she's very talented and very persistent Eve when she gets this message it's garbage she can't understand it it would take a very very long time by brute force alone to try to go ahead and figure out what this message is billions of years or millions of years more a lot of time even factoring in the growth of computer rate however because Alice has that pre shared key that secret key what Alice is able to do is take that secret key and it's going to go ahead and spit out the original message and Eve will never know she can never know that so that's pre-shared keys and this is called symmetric cryptography symmetric in that you use the same key to go ahead and encrypt and decrypt the messages and for a long time this happened to be the cryptographic paradigm that we lived in for a very very very long time you'd use one key to encrypt the same key to decrypt and you'd share the key and it would take some time and effort to go ahead and share that key and thus encryption and decryption was kind of a luxury reserved by governments and so forth but let's say let's look at a new example well here is instead of Alice and Bob let's go ahead and look at amazon.com okay so amazon.com I think this is their logo it has a tasting so amazon.com it lives it somewhere in California and they have many many servers okay do you go ahead whenever you want to buy something securely on Amazon Drive out there with your car go to their facility and say oh hey give me the pre-shared keys so that I can securely give you my credit card number no it's madness you don't do that however there are evil hackers out there who if given the opportunity would love to steal any insecure information over transit give him a cape because he's a bad guy and a monocle there we go so if you were just to go ahead and send your credit card number this evil guy let's call him James my apologies if there's any James listening viewing is gonna get your credit card number but you can't drive to California to have a pre-shared key this is impossible there's no way you're gonna be able if it's going to be a scalable business to go ahead and grab that pre-shared he so then a natural question is how do we securely send something to Amazon without James here who is very talented and very evil figuring it out and making money off of us well this is where the notion of a public private key cryptographic scheme comes from so the first was RSA it was rendered by Revis Shamir and Adleman and what they basically did is they say okay what we're going to do is have a public key that everybody in the world knows it's public and we're gonna call that k1 and so what Bob is gonna do is he's going to take that encryption function he's gonna take the message that he wants to encrypt he's gonna take our public key and it's gonna create an encrypted message but there is no way to decrypt this message with that public key meaning if James was to intercept this encrypted message that sent across the channel James would not be able to decrypt it with just the public key instead what we're gonna have is a private key right over here a private key and this private key k1 Keisuke to allows somebody who has a message encrypted with a public key to be able to decrypt to be able to decrypt that message into the original message now the details of the system are a little complex in terms of RSA involves integer factorization the system that the Bitcoin uses is called elliptic curve digital signing algorithm there are are many systems DLP is one and there are some next generation public private key systems that have been invented that are very promising but the general concept in all of these systems are always the same a person wants to send a message to an entity that they've never met and they know nothing about but they have verified that that entity has a public key it belongs to that entity this is Amazon coms public key and there's a very complex system of certificates and verification services and so forth that exists specifically to go ahead and ensure that people's identities are verified online so you have used some sort of system your browser to verify yes this is indeed amazon.com then what you do is say okay give me your public key you go ahead and take this encryption function it's it going to be the RSA function or something like that and you take the message you want to send alongside the public key and it creates an encrypted message and when our good friend James here attempts to steal it he's very frustrated he's sad because he's not able to decrypt it but the private key can now there's a relationship between the private key and the public key k1 and k2 are related to each other okay in that the private key usually can build the public key however you can't go the other way so going from this direction it's a very quick operation going in the other direction it's a very slow operation it's one that would take lots and lots and lots of time so this is kind of the cryptographic foundation of the Bitcoin the general idea is that when we want to send money to somebody so here's your Bitcoin yeah Bitcoin okay so I want to send this Bitcoin from Charles to let's say James because maybe we're working together James is a good friend of mine he sells mccain's I want to send him one Bitcoin it's a very expensive King okay so what I'm going to do is the Bitcoin network is going to say well Charles it's a really a wonderful thing that you assert that you own that Bitcoin okay it's really a wonderful thing that you claim that you own this Bitcoin however you have to prove it the Bitcoin has two parts using that digital signing algorithm it has a public key and a private key and everybody in the network understands the public key okay but only I own the private key it's the only person in the world that knows that so using my private key I can verify that I do own that Bitcoin and I am authorized to go ahead and transact it over to James so only the person who holds the private key for a particular Bitcoin is capable of going ahead and transmitting that Bitcoin and that assertion that you own it can be verified because people can do a test with that public key so here's an example let's say I claim I own that key I own hi okay and you say well you prove it so here's how we're gonna do that you're going to take something like candy okay and you're gonna treat me like James you're gonna take candy you're gonna take the public key and you're going to encrypt it with the public key and it's gonna spit out something which is garbage like this noise okay and you're gonna send me that noise now if I am the owner of that public key if I produce that then I'm going to be able to take that garbage run my private key through it and it's gonna pop out candy okay and I'm gonna send it back to you and so the question you're gonna ask is what did I send you Charles and I'm gonna say you sent me the string candy or whatever test you want to use the Bitcoin network works in a similar way for transactions when you are transacting between two entities entity one has to prove that they are the owner of the coin and then one entity two receives that coin entity two has now bound that coin to his public private key pair and because entity two is the only person who owns the private key entity two is now the only person who is capable of spending that key so that's basically the bitcoins encryption in a nutshell I'm not going to go over the elliptic curve digital signing algorithm nor am I going to go over the protocols on how exactly this proof works it's it's not necessary to really understand the cryptographic security what is necessary to understand is that going from the public key to the private key with the particular algorithm is impossible in normal time a ECDSA is very secure it's used by the CIA and also by the NSA amongst other agencies and so there's a consensus that this cryptographic method is nearly unbreakable unless you have lots of special information and it's not been implemented correctly from the many thousands of security experts who have looked at the bitcoins implementation of ECDSA along with all the other nifty security details of the Bitcoin the network as a whole absolutely believes that the public/private key scheme that they've implemented and the authentication system that they've implemented is indeed secure in fact it's so secure it's much much more secure than regular online transactions and this is why we say bitcoins are better than credit cards or bitcoins are better than cash transfers in etc etc okay that's all I have for you if this lecture makes sense go ahead and let me know if it doesn't make any sense at all I'll I'll try to redo it and become a better artist and I hope that helps clear up a little bit of stuff about the concept of encryption and decryption as it relates to the Bitcoin thank you much and have a wonderful day",

            "transcript": "  [Music] what's up this cashier I take a cash TV hi I'm doing so you guys I'm coming on here to talk a little bit about cryptocurrency Bitcoin for those of you who have no idea what it is this video is for you if you wanna if you're more involved in the cryptocurrency space I'm not an expert but I'm gonna explain it to you guys from my understanding of it there's a lot to know when it comes to cryptocurrency and Bitcoin but honestly it can be a little bit confusing so I personally don't think that everyone needs to know every little every single thing there is to know about it like right away you just need to know the basics to get involved so that's what I'm gonna be talking about how I understand it and what you should know if you are a completely beginner and you're just wanting to jump in so you guys know who mark is right mark started talking about Bitcoin about nine months ago and at the time like I didn't really know what he was talking about like I had heard of Bitcoin a few years ago but I just thought it was like like play money like I didn't think that it was like anything of value so when Mark starts talking to me about it he like baby Bitcoin Bitcoin oh my gosh we got a research everything there is to know about big my mind mark you need to calm down so he kind of became obsessed and he started like researching all the time like oh my gosh you guys are not even kidding like mark was just over doing it like he's like I learned everything there is to know about I'm like okay but like what about us hanging out sometime you know as soon as cutting into our our life you know what I mean I was cutting into our us time so whatever I was like okay let's let him figure out like how long did it take to figure out everything you need to know about Bitcoin like shouldn't be that complicated so anyway he finally got over the kind of obsession stage but even still I wasn't interested in it because I didn't really get it like I didn't really get what the hype was so fast forward so like now and I finally get it but I had to do a little bit of research on my own now there's already youtubers out there guys to explain exactly what bitcoin is and there's some that really do it well some that will just leave you confused basically from my understanding bitcoin is digital money and it's backed by regular money ok that's how I understand it let's talk about Bitcoin bitcoin is Bitcoin is the most popular coin out there and it's the coin that started it all but there's also a lot of other coins out there that are called alt coins and those coins also have really big potential for like huge gains and profits so but anyway everybody talks about bitcoin but bitcoin is already doing a lot like bitcoin is already up there right guys so before I start talking about the other stuff I'm just gonna go ahead and let you guys know that there's this site called coin market kit and this is the site that really helped me understand it you look go on the site and you can see the top you can see all the coins but what you'll see at first is like the top 100 coins and it shows you how much 1 point is worth for each coin the 24-hour volume like how many people are invested in it and it shows the charts of like the ups and downs of the the coins existence so what you'll see is that it's not just about Bitcoin there's like I'm alright almost a million but there's like a thousand plus other coins now obviously a lot of those coins are just like not even worth investing in so that's where you you know you want to get an understanding of how to pick a coin and how to decide what you want invest in so basically glencoe market cat you check out these coins and if you decide that you want to start investing in coins the first step is getting a coin based account which Mike Howard you set me up you guys mark set me up a coin based account before I was even interested like there was a day that it came that I was like alright mark I want some coins and my point being I was already said of cuz mark I did that which I appreciate that and then okay so on coinbase basically that's where you can buy the top coin so Bitcoin like aetherium litecoin and you're gonna use whatever you buy in there to get the alt coins because for me all coins is where the real potential for making a lot of money is so yeah you're gonna get like saving you by like like coin you buy $20 of like coin and then you want to use that $20 to invest in some penny coins you know how to mean or some coin sets even work less than a penny you can put five dollars on a coin and just wait for it to grow United mean because of you by a penny coin at five dollars that's 500 of those coins and then when it becomes worth a dollar that's 500 dollars and then when it goes up again that's even more money so that's kind of my basic understanding of it basically it's backed by the money we put into it and I believe that that's how the value increases I could be wrong somebody if y'all got any experts out there watching me let me know is it it's backed by real money and that's what gives it value but it's a digital currency and so you can use it all around the world and yeah it cuts out you know the whole banking process and on that and yeah so that's my basic understanding of it but what's exciting is like what I was telling you guys about those little cost coins like you can invest like a hundred dollars and get like what invest in just like a few coins and then just watch that investment grow cuz like it's almost guaranteed to grow but then also is it is going to be going up and down but for my experience you guys so okay I've been I have about 30 plus coins right and so far I've invested like I invested I'm investing small you guys cuz you know I'm kind of new to it so I invested like $150 and right now my portfolio is at about $500 so so obviously you can tell some of my coins increase I got one coin and really increase tonight so it was kind of cool cuz like basically I go on coin like a cat and I look to see which coins are like really cheap and but a lot of people are interested in and that's pretty much how I decide which coins are less than Y all I invested five dollars in a coin I think I got 200 of them and then like within a month or two that coin shot up and so my father investment had turned to like $200 it was something like that I was like whoa so it's exciting to see when it grows but then you also have to know that it's gonna go down too sometimes so it's like it's like a long-term savings sort of thing so you can't be all like I'm looking at every day and I really don't think you have to be an upset you just have nice a little just to get your feet wet see what it does to our let your intuition guide you or whatever you call lawns I guide you and yeah so I'll put a link to coinbase get your coins you get the main coins on coin beats there's like I think four or five and then you send those coins to an exchange I use crypto PIA most of my clients are cattle via then once you're on the exchange you can buy other points now figuring out how to buy other coins so it's really not that complicated but you probably need to watch a video or something so I'll put my legs in the description box I think they're they do have like an affiliate kind of thing where if you sign up to coinbase we both get money after you invest a certain amount so I bought those pretty cool so I'll put my links because why not and yeah I'm excited to invest in more coins but it's just so crazy how many coins are I'm like my advice is to go on plan market cap and then check out some coins click on their website so you can see what the coin is about because there like I said there's coins for everything music coin art coin virtual reality coin technology like there's a lot of coins alright you guys I hope that explained it well and I will see you guys the next oh my gosh I just was I was looking at myself the whole time hey you guys I actually did cut off a little bit in the front I like how it looks you know I like it I'm growing it out my little fro alright I will see you guys [Applause]",

            "transcript": "  Bitcoin mining he's probably been hearing about this everywhere especially given the barren wasteland that is trying to find any decent AMD GPU for sale new or even used I did a quick fun video a few days ago about how I use the mining ring to keep my room and a few of you were interested in me doing a beginner's guide to get started with mining so here is said video a lot of stress that this is strictly a beginner slash noob guide to mining and it won't be diving into anything too complex like flashing bios's under volting or manipulating your GPU in any way let me know though if you're interested in such a video down below in the comments but for this video we're going to stick to the basics let me give you some background on mining Before we jump into the how you do it portion I'll do my best to keep this brief and simple but that will mean I'm sacrificing nuance for ease here the goal isn't to get you to understand how everything works just a general idea of what you'll be messing with so while the world is discussing Bitcoin mining that's actually a bit of a misnomer bitcoin has become a catch-all phrase for most types of crypto currencies kind of how like a hook and loop strap is known as velcro or gelatin is known as jello or tissues are known as Kleenex there's various types of crypto currencies even if they get referred to as the generic trademark of Bitcoin so when you see everyone using their arcs 480 or 5 80s for mining they're likely not mining Bitcoin exactly but a Bitcoin alternative known as alt coin there's a bunch of different types of allah coins such as light coin dogecoin z cash and the most popular one for mining at this point aetherium okay so with that out of the way here's the super rough not entirely accurate broad understanding of how you mind for these currencies essentially you take your computer flip on a program and that program uses your computer's horsepower to validate certain metrics in a data set and then based on how much data you process you in return get paid for your services again not entirely correct by the simple picture the closest thing I could compare it to is like folding at home you dedicate your hardware to help process information with regards to protein folding with distributed computing but instead of helping save lives you make money well you don't exactly make money you earn the cryptocurrency Bitcoin aetherium whatever and because other individuals have determined that those crypto currencies can be used to make a transaction there's monetary value attached to the jeez I've already poorly explained cryptocurrency mining and now I'm giving you a crippled understanding of fiat currencies anyways summation you give the cloud your GPU they give you currency you sell the currency for cash okay forget me trying to explain things now it's time to move on to how to actually do it there's a thousand different ways to set up a miner but I'm going to go over one of the most popular ways and then also show you some of the limitations of it the incredibly simple ways to download nice hash miner from the website in the video description and just run the program the few things you'll need to get started are your computer obviously but then also a Bitcoin address which is essentially where nice hash should deposit the currency that you earn how do you get a Bitcoin address well you need a wallet which is principally where you're going to store your cryptocurrency there are a thousand different wallets you can set up online but I keep mine with a Bitcoin exchange as that allows me to transfer the cryptocurrency into dollars in my american bank account through your own research on where it's best for you to store the currency whether that be in a dedicated wallet or if you just plan on hoarding your coins or in an exchange because you want to trade it within to your local currency I'll put some links in the video description to help you guys make that decision wherever you end up storing your coins it'll generate the address that you need to put into the nice hash miner in order to start earning once you have that address here's the super simple part the miner automatically detects which Hardware you have you click on benchmark and the program will check your hardware against roughly ten or so different types of actual cryptocurrency miners to see how well your PC performs once the benchmarking is done and you start the actual mining nice hash will run the miners for you and also switch to whichever type of currency might be most profitable for your system to be mining at any given time the nice hash miner converts whatever currency remaining directly into Bitcoin and will only deposit Bitcoin to your account you can set the program up to do a whole host of things like only mine once it reaches a certain profitability level or run when the computer is idle so it will turn on whenever you've stopped using your PC which is a nice feature if you're forgetful about turning this kind of stuff on which I know I am super simple super easy you click start and you're off to the races earning money using your PC hardware for distributed however with anything that's simple there's nuance that's left out that you may or may not want to know for example nice hash only pays out in Bitcoin which may not be your preferred currency to keep also pay out times vary from either every day or once a week depending on how much Bitcoin you actually mine which could be too infrequent or too soon depending on how you want to be paid however overall if you just want to set it and forget it option nice hash is a superb program for that I keep it running on all the computers in my office and I'm currently earning in the neighborhood of like 30 to 35 dollars per day depending on the given exchange rate which comes out to a thousand dollars a month at the current exchange rate which isn't too bad however if you don't want the simple way you can run the individual miners yourself by downloading them and setting them up I'll be in a less user friendly manner if you want to make sure you're only ever mining one specific altcoin or you prefer different payment structures or you just want more control over what each program is doing but then you also have to get into the idea of mining pools which I'll include a link in the video description for but I'm not going to address that here this all sounds really great and almost too good to be true you use your electricity and your PC to generate cash where's the catch well it's in several places so let's spend the time to talk about that the most obvious is that you have to make sure that the cost you're spending on electricity is less than the value of what you're mining in the currency otherwise you're upside-down and just spending more money on electricity then you're getting back you can definitely choose to do that if you think that the value of the coins in the future will be worth the cost that you're putting into it right now but that's a gamble so I personally only mind if the profit from the currencies exceeds my electricity costs so with that let's take a look at the GPUs I currently have on hand the gtx 1060 GT x 1080 with updated memory and RX 480 and 2rx 580 s1 with 4 gigabytes of vram and one with 8 gigabytes let's take them and throw them at noise hashes profitability calculator and determine their value this is just going to be a quick and dirty calculation not going into nuance just using the data that nice hash themselves provide to us for any of the GPUs that I mentioned based on the speculated cost and amount of dollars per day you can earn with the cards the time to pay off each dpu is between 57 days and 91 days depending on what your card you're talking about or 2 to 3 months and that's even with taking the normal cost of electricity in consideration not too shabby definitely seems worth it however while this is a super helpful chart to determine current profitability of the GPUs that's basically all it does and that's a big problem if you're looking to invest into mining right now what do you mean by big problem Brett I'm glad you asked Internet person there are two major variables that these calculators typically don't take into account because they're super difficult to predict those are the future price of the currency and the difficulty increases with mining the price fluctuation should be an obvious idea to everyone the market determines the value of the currency which varies wildly on any given day last week Bitcoin peaked at $3,000 per coin but then straight up plummeted closer to the $2,000 region shortly after but is now again in the mid 2000s that's some straight-up scary volatility if you ask me a lot of people are agreeing right now that the price of cryptocurrency is basically inflated due to a speculative bubble which means it could end these prices high prices at any moment and bring everyone back to an unprofitable mining status or much less profitable mining status although that's again entirely speculation and not a guarantee the prices are hard to now the second factor that I mentioned is the difficulty of the mining itself as more and more people come in and start doing these distributed computing calculations the difficulty of the calculations increase and your current hardware isn't able to get as much of the share due to it now being slower in terms of the hash rate this difficulty change is inevitable and it isn't something that's easy to predict as the scene of mining is changing so rapidly however there are some basic calculators that you can use that take a generic difficult to increase into account and shows you what profits will be going out the overall profits from each TV you aren't as high as you would expect even two years later and for some based on the guesswork of the difficulty increase will actually start to cost you money even less than one year out obviously the nice hash program can get you around this because it switches to mine the most profitable currencies and you can set it to only mine at a certain profitability level but it's something to definitely should be keeping in mind then there's the other issue that the amount of VRAM on certain GPUs likely won't be enough going forward especially if you're mining a cerium the dag file directed acyclic graph associated with mining a cerium gets larger all the time currently it's on pace to start affecting four gigabyte GPUs in the near future and their ability to mine which obviously can't be accounted for in current profitability charts but may make all those four gig AMD GPUs harder to pay off which doesn't even take into account the chances of aetherium going proof a steak instead of proof of work but that's an entirely different conversation altogether so with difficulty increases in price fluctuations and the fact that poor gigabyte cards may or may not be enough depending on the currency your mining it's actually really tough to predict what the exact time of return on investment will be for your GPU setup if the bubble burst and prices crashed the ROI could be measured in months or years rather than days or it wouldn't be worth it at all because the cost of electricity will outpace the return of value in the currency this isn't to say don't mind far from it actually I just wanted to make this video to Requip you with the basic knowledge to get into mining and then also to keep an eye out for the impending changes that could cost you if you decide to spend a lot of money on a mining right now but on the flip side the prices can continue to go up you make a return on the hardware that you bought before it becomes unprofitable and you win and all of my negative speculation isn't worth anything however my current plan is to just run the hardware that I have on hand until the cost of electricity outpaces the profit that I make the speculative bubble just seems too risky for my tastes and I'd rather buy up the GPUs that everyone is selling dirt-cheap once everything crashes rather than to try and get in right at this moment but I'll be including all the resources that I mentioned in this video as well as a few others in the video description down below to help you guys out and make these decisions for yourself there's definitely value in getting into cryptocurrency mining right now for many people however it could just as quickly hurt you if you invest expecting to make a quick return and things go steps my aim isn't to tell you what to do but rather give you information to determine what you want to do but to save this video from getting too long I'm going to end it there I'm keen to hear what you guys have in terms of hardware and is profitable for mining altcoins or if you're planning on getting into the mining game right now and buying the hardware to do so tell me all about it in the comments down below let's have a conversation down there also be sure to hit the like button if you found this video helpful at all subscribe if you're new around here and want to stay up-to-date on my tech related content and I'll see you guys in the next video Cheers [Music]",

            "transcript": "  welcome to NCIX tech tips today's episode is all about those crypto currencies that you've been hearing so much about there are a ton of them floating around now everyone wants a piece of the pie but the main ones are Bitcoin litecoin peercoin namecoin and dogecoin and cat coin actually no I'm just kidding about those last two they do really exist in fact people are making money on cat coin at the moment but anyway those four first ones are sort of the more relevant ones we're gonna give you a rundown about this cryptocurrency thing and what it's all about so at the most basic level these crypto currencies are really no different than the money that you have in your wallet in similar to this money in my wallet it has no intrinsic value it's just bits of data whereas this is just pieces of paper you can't actually really do much with this other than like throw it in the air like a rap star or like you know strength menacing poses and hold large wads of it or whatever else you want to do it also bears some similarity to commodities like gold or diamonds though so there's no central bank that controls it and keeping with that theme of no control like golden diamonds it can be sent directly from user to user without any credit card companies banks or other intermediaries now unlike also similar to gold but unlike the rap status paper you can't just print a bunch of a cryptocurrency they are actually they need to be mined so at the heart of Bitcoin for example there is a mathematical problem users solve these problems with high-end computer parts graphics cards are better than CPUs and beyond those are ASIC cards and every time a solution to the problem is found there is a reward given in the form of a Bitcoin now the difficulty of this math problem varies with the strength of the network so that the solutions are found at regular intervals every 10 minutes on average the reward also varies or the reward itself also varies except it is tied to a four-year scale which started at 10.5 million coins in the first year and then will have now eventually we're going to reach the upper limit of 21 million bitcoins and after that like gold once we run out of it we can't mine more and the theory is that bitcoins will become more expensive as they become more rare and people eventually lose them I mean once you lose a wallet full of bitcoins those bitcoins are gone forever but don't worry guys there is a saving grace unlike normal currency that can only make smaller denominations like pennies and dollars bitcoins can actually be divided up to eight decimal places so zero point zero zero zero zero zero zero zero one Bitcoin would be the smallest denomination of Bitcoin that's how even with a Bitcoin hovering at you know anywhere between 500 to 1500 dollars Canadian depending on the time of day and you know what's going on out there in the market you can still just use a fraction of that to pay for a pack of gum for example it's not like oh well do you have changed for $700 for the second no it's not like that now the way that bitcoins are stored is in a virtual wallet which basically keeps a unique record of every single transaction and also allows you to send and receive bitcoins all transactions are also verified by the miners and that record is permanently stored by all members of the network so that means that transactions can take a few minutes in order to complete and verify that it has actually gone through so that is the general idea behind Bitcoin and cryptocurrency is really as a whole but what about all these other crypto currencies we've mostly talked about Bitcoin so far well there are three main litecoin pure coin and named coin like coins are the second biggest cryptocurrency right now with the main advantage I guess being that they're a lot cheaper they're easier to mine and there are also about four times faster when completing a transaction speaking of them being easier to mine litecoin is also ASIC resistant which means that ASIC cards and machines that are special pieces of hardware that are built simply to mine cryptocurrency faster is not that effective on it now speaking of Asics let's talk a little bit about what those are so for for Bitcoin particularly because it's not easy like resistant ASIC cards and machines built simply to mine Bitcoin way faster than even the highest end consumer grade hardware so to put it in perspective the fastest video card produces between 1 to 2 kilo hash which is the unit of measurement for how quickly you can calculate cryptocurrency so these dedicated cards compared to one point two kilo hash can produce up to 1,500 Giga hash at power consumptions that are much lower power consumption is one of the major costs of mining bitcoins because you have to have the hardware working extremely hard so essentially like coins when I say ASIC resistant it means that they are much harder to make dedicated Hardware for and GPUs graphics cards remain the most efficient way to mine them and that makes them much more accessible than the two thousand plus dollar ASIC Monster dedicated hardware and in addition to that you can actually use your graphics card for other things so it's more for real people normal people now all the other currencies have their unique spin but I won't bog you too much down with all of that just check out the description to learn more about them but in summary bitcoins are a virtual currency which like we said it's not really that different from a paper currency this is sort of virtual value as well you can mine them with high-end computer parts or ASIC miners there are a maximum of 21 million bitcoins out there 12 million of which have already been found and all the transactions are publicly and anonymously stored now stay tuned tomorrow guys because we are going to go over exactly how to build a Bitcoin mining rig if this little video here has piqued your interest what you might need and we're gonna show off wheels is Frankenstein system that is hard at work right now mining in the next room",

            "transcript": " hello everyone is steven is  today video that I imagine is going to be  long since you saw it in the  title we will talk about bitcoin that makes  a lot of time that you ask me to  you talk about it and I'm going to do it there  today so here it was not  all a video that was planned but you  may have heard the valuation  of bitcoin there today at the moment  I record this video has exceeded the  Symbolic landing of the 10 thousand dollars  good at the moment when going out to this video this  may be a little more or a little  the less you know that it varies enormously  but today this is a your bitcoin  ten thousand dollars  it sounds crazy and I thought  it was time to discuss  together because it's a subject  exciting not so obvious that that to  understand that it's rather complex  so I'll try to explain that to you  simply myself I struggled to  understand at the beginning is the same  today I am still far from everything  to master at 100% but I understood  the essential  so I'm going to simplify as much as possible  take some easy examples speaking for  everybody  and well in fact I'll explain it to you  in the way I would have liked  explain to me when I started to  to interest me and basle I caught  information a little bit right at  left where I could so here I am  will you explain it with my words to  what I would have liked to hear because  that you'll see that eventually it's  not so complicated  I will do very little editing in  this video a game just like that to  discuss with you face camera i'm going  start by explaining yourself what is this  what is bitcoin like?  works  basically once you understand that  you will see it does not take long  I will explain how to buy  how to invest in it if you have been  convinced by the techno obviously and  that it interests you so if ever  you are already interested in it since  little moment that you already enter the  operating principle of bitcoin  but you still hesitate to  buy because you do not know where  nor which platform to trust  or not  I invite you to go directly to the  part of this video where I talk about it I  shows you the right time code in  below go to that moment and then  you will be everything you need  to know  Well, it was a long time  intro but I think it's good  let's go  [Music]  bitcoin that's what's called a  crypto currency a virtual currency  you can not have a coin or a  bitcoin ticket is the spend at the  bakery to buy your bread  unlike a classic currency  for example the euro the dollar the yen or  Any other currency that you  know all  they are related to states they  depend on a central bank that  regulates these currencies by creating and  checking all transactions  especially bitcoin is like all  others  crypto currency he is not dependent  of a state of a government of a bank  but that's not to say that  not regulated actually it is because  we call the chain blocks all of which  the world can be part of which all the  world can participate  schematizing again roughly  today with our operation  current every time you make a  bank transaction this transaction  it must be verified when one wants  make a payment our bank is going  check that the recipient has a good  account we have the funds that  we want to transfer then she goes  move money from one account to another  it's your bank that they control  your money good that you know him  very well when you want to send a  euro it goes like this  now we will take another  example I want to send a bitcoin is  well, it's not a single entity that's  not a bank that will check the  transaction it's going to be millions of  people around the world with everyone  a computer and who so everyone with  their computers will check this  wholesale transaction is what I  does have this bitcoin that I try  to send yes is that the person to  who I have to send it has well  a bitcoin address yes ok we validate the  transaction is there all these  verification steps all that big  computer calculations if you want and  well instead of it being done by a  it's done by all the people who  make up the shane blocks all are going to do  the same calculation so after a certain  time when a number have  provided the same result for this calculation  well we'll say ok it's saif have  validated the transaction understand that  that's how it works  transactions instead of being  verified by a single person by a  single entity by a bank for example  Well they are checked by  miles  a person and that's why we say  that bitcoin and all the others  crypto currencies are currencies  decentralized all these people with  their computers who chose  to use their low computing power  to participate in the verification of these  we call them the miners said  that they mine bitcoin for example the  in reward for their work their  participation in the validation of all  these transactions  they will receive a small commission  transactions made in addition  some of the new bitcoins  create each day so it's like that  we create bitcoin that's how  new bitcoin arrives in  circulation every day as and when  transaction measurement  again roughly 1 that's why  for example and I imagine you in  may have also heard that  some have made machines  specialized capable of a big  computing power is optimized  for mining in order to recover a  larger portion of the portions of  bitcoins that could not do a  simple computer alone here and finally he  must understand that all these  transactions they are written and  remain visible in the blue jam on  could see this as a huge book  a register in fact that one can  consult at any time that they keep  a trace for us to check and  ensures that all transactions that  have been made are correct this is  moreover for that only when we  talk it says that the network is  transparent and anonymous transparent  because I just told you everything  is written everything is visible and that if  these transactions can be viewed  to verify that they are accurate one  do not know who made them  we only see addresses  hence the anonymous side is also  for that in its beginnings and again  today in some people the  bitcoin has a bad reputation because  that it was used for purposes  malicious to buy weapons by  example by people who  benefited from this anonymous side  again I'm simplifying a lot  for you to understand obviously in  anyway here it is finally not so  complicated than that and I hope you  understand how it works  bitcoin is a crypto currency  virtual currency that we do not have  physical support  like coins or banknotes  decentralized and regulated by the blocks  chain a set of users who  plays the role of the bank and checks the  trading transactions are simple  fast and one remains master of his  money I will not go into the  details here but it is possible to have  constantly and bitcoin on all while  knowing them to good security now  that you have the basics you ask yourself  maybe the question why the  bitcoin is so expensive why  today it is worth ten thousand dollars  while it was worth half a sixth  months and not even milan early 2017 so  that the euro to take its example and  regulated by the central bank the  bitcoin him his value is going to be determined  by the uses made of it by the  trend of the moment so many sell  they go down and if on the contrary a lot  seek to get it he increases  logic eh it's the very principle of  supply and demand  second particularity and it's the most  important when creating the  bitcoin when defining its  operation and its code  it was chosen that eventually there would be  than 21 million by one more so mine  it's not much  and today all have not yet been  created by the miners there is if I  say no nonsense 16 million in  circulation and it will take tens and  dozens of years to create the  last knowing that it puts more and  more time once these 21  million bitcoin will have been created low  we will continue to exchange them in  classic way except that there will be  not one more this rarity that's what  give it its value  in fact you see that as a metal  precious gold for example there is none  many very much want it for  that it's expensive the same thing for the  today bitcoin is telling you a thousand  dollars and we find it extremely expensive  but we also found that extremely  expensive when it was worth 8000 when he  was worth 5000 when it was worth 2000 in  beginning of the year and so now  that you know what it is with the  bitcoin now that you understand  in broad outline  functioning I let you do  your choice be you do not believe it  you think it's not a  technology of the future that it is  just a fad and that's okay  disappear as fast as it appeared  or while it's not bad but that it has  inflated much too fast that the bitcoin  will never be worth more than what it is worth  currently be like me believe you  by blocking it chain you believe in  the future of bitcoin is there you are  ask maybe the question down how  is that I can get the  bitcoin how is it traded or is that  I can buy some  resell eh ben that's what I'm going  show you in this second part  videos and there before I start  absolutely want to emphasize one point  invest only what you are  ready to lose you repeat it only  what you are ready to lose  yes today the bitcoin your ten thousand  dollars but in a month he can in  worth half less and in a year more  nothing at all I do not know you do not  know nothing nobody knows about it and  those who tell you the inversion of  liars we can not predict at all  with certainty the future of bitcoin that me  seems obvious but I'm going to say it  even if you are young  do not borrow the bank card from your  parents if you have a student loan to  refund a credit for a car or  a flat  do not use this money to invest  in the bitcoin did not use the money  you need on a daily basis  rust we've seen people's stories  who sold their house for everything  invest in bitcoin and who  today are millionaires but that's  does not prevent that it's absolutely stupid  as behavior is way too much  risky tell you well that if you  invest 100 euros in a month they  can very well be worth 200 or so  10 invest only one more  time I repeat what you are  well here we go anyway continue on  a note a little more joyful and for  tell you about the island particularity of the  bitcoin that a lot of people do not  do not grab because I'm  okay it's not necessarily obvious to  actually understand even though today  the bitcoin again  thousand dollars if you want to invest  you do not have to buy a  whole bitcoin and so to spend 10  you can buy a fraction of  bitcoin as today there are  cents you can buy  cents of bitcoin in description  of the video I put you a link so  clicked on it just will you  take on this interface  there we invite you to register so  my feast the wine inform your few  information does not commit you to anything clay  your account and you can like that  access the second part of the site that  looks like that we are shown the  current valuation of bitcoin  moment when I turn this video so a  little more than 9000 euros and ten thousand five  hundred and a few dollars and there the  evolution curve over one year  if you wish you can  the posted on a month you see that it  fits on a day or to go  even further if you want to  can display her on an hour so that  it's for bitcoin but you see  that you also have the opportunity to  select the summer rome where the light  coyne other crypto currency that he is  possible to buy on the platform is  just not to buy it is very  simple here in the settings you  can fill in your means of payment  so be a credit card me I have  two or a bank account I have one  the main differences and they  are explained here it's going to be level  payment caps if you  use a bank account you can  have a much higher ceiling by  against the time to put all this in  place to transfer the funds that it's going  take much longer then that  with a credit card to your purchase it  really immediate then he will you  can you go to the purchase tab  sale and here's how it's going  present there you see that for  the moment it is the bitcoin which is  selected I can also bought from  the straight end of the light cone if I  wish and  as a payment method I have my card  bank that makes signed here just in  below for purchases at  credit card platform  does not authorize more than 500 euros of purchase  per month with a bank account this will  so much more so here let's admit that I  want to buy for 100 euros  the calculation is done automatically  see that it gives me the equivalent of  0.01 bitcoins quite valid at the moment  I'm doing this video at the current course of  bitcoin there you see 9260 2.57 euros  for 1 8 km  that's why it gives me this  equivalent for 100 euros of purchase  then you can notice it here in  down in the recap I have a fee  for this transaction  it is a percentage that is calculated  by the way I tell you the cost  are more important if you pay by  credit card only if you make a  transfer directly  in short, I do not want to go into these details  I will let you know about  the percentages of fees that's all  explained on the site  just know that if you are  registered with the link I put you  in description of the video which is a  referral link  from the moment you put 100  euros you have 9 euros which are you  offered so you pay by card or  by transfer it reimburses you your  first charges that's why I want you  advises this platform is not there  another one if you want to start very  gently is really easily you  have seen that really everything is crystal clear  on this platform looks really  easy to use for beginners  then if you want to invest a lot  the more it is not here that it will be necessary  to pass at that moment I invite you to  inquire with the links I have  quickly in the description of the video or  then come talk to me about it on twitter  will discuss it I will give you the  best methods but to start  to start a small investment  it's the easiest way to do  as I just showed you here  other platforms exist more or  less complicated and different in  function of what you really want  do you can go take a look  how does this one already I  think because I'm telling you I  find that it's really the simplest  for beginners I do not know them  it's not a product placement or  anything it's just not  really my opinion a deer on it's  what I used when I started  once you have bought your  first fraction of bitcoin you can  either leave them here on the platform  if you have the idea to resell them  soon because you think  you have made sufficient value  what I wish you besides and  that you want not recovered their value  in euros put them back on your account  banking or simply  get your bet back and then  you tell yourself everything  it's a bonus you can very well  do it the same way you  have sent your euros on the platform  to buy bitcoins you can  sell his bitcoin recover their value  at current price in euros recovered these  euros to your bank account but if  on the contrary like me you see on the  long term that you do not have at all  the intention for the moment to sell your  bitcoin we'll have to secure them  understand well that as long as he stays on  a stock exchange traded it does you  do not belong totally fashion  besides, I can very well make a  video to explain that to you if ever  tell me in the comments if  many of you are interested in  the thing because that is nothing  super important to know how the  secure ben I will explain you  really with pleasure  good here it is I think now  you know just about everything me you  will have understood it I see on the long  term for now I keep them  but it's not me who will tell you  what to do with me is what I think  the bitcoin is in quotation marks again  cheap compared to the price he  will be worth in four or five years  indeed even if today is the  crypt currency most used  it will not necessarily be the case in  a few years another more optimized  may be used in place of the  bitcoin we will not buy our bread the  morning with bitcoins but knowing  that it is limited in quantity that  some cryptocurrency  besides, even no value in euros  but in bitcoin for example for me  will remain the crypto monnet mayor and for  take again the example of gold that I you  gave earlier if today we  do not buy his bread with a gold bar  because it's not practical  Well, it does not prevent it from staying  safe value a safe haven  I wanted to say I do not read the future I  can be wrong but for me it is not  not too late to invest if you  want to do it little by little  for example instead of eating at mcdo and  Well, I was 10 euros in bitcoin  again do not take risks  and especially especially if you choose  to invest does it because you are there  and not because someone will have told you  that it was the right time to do it  me if you absolutely want my opinion  down I meant I think we in  is still at the beginning of today  some big companies like expedia  or microsoft have for example allowed  as an official means of payment but the  day when it will be amazon he will not want ten  a thousand but we can easily add  one more zero here are your antics it was  rather long a very beautiful go there I hope  that it was worth it  g  you understood I really did  all I can to explain it to you  in the easiest way possible  really using the words the  way I would have liked to hear it  me when I started to be there  because it's way too important  to miss out on that just  saying wow it's too complicated  not for me now you do  part of the people who know and take the  decisions that you want to take  if you still have questions  the comments just below are  facts for that we will discuss all  together if you have more questions  do not hesitate to come and tell me about it  twitter i would answer you if i have the  answer if you have any suggestions  other ideas that you would like me to  develops in other videos and low and  if you're not talking to me about it  I think we'll talk about  security because it's really  and then by then I tell you to very  soon for a next go hi ",

HackerSploit here back again with another video, in this video, I am going to be introducing you to the world of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, what they are and how they work.\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a digital payment system invented by an unknown programmer, or a group of programmers, under the name Satoshi Nakamoto. It was released as open-source software in 2009.\n\nThe system is peer-to-peer, and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain. Since the system works without a central repository or single administrator, bitcoin is called the first decentralized digital currency.\n\nWebsite\nFinerCoder Website : http://finercoder.com/\n\nI Hope you enjoy/enjoyed the video.\nIf you have any questions or suggestions feel free to ask them in the comments section or on my social networks as well as my blog.\n\nSOCIAL NETWORKS\n-------------------------------\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/HackerSploit/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/HackerSploit\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/hacker_sploit\nKik Username: HackerSploit\nPatreon: http://patreon.com/hackersploit\n--------------------------------\n\nThanks for watching!\n\u0411\u043b\u0430\u0433\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0440\u044f \u0437\u0430 \u0433\u043b\u0435\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0435\u0442\u043e\n\u611f\u8c22\u60a8\u89c2\u770b\nMerci d'avoir regard\u00e9\nGracias por ver\n\u0634\u0643\u0631\u0627 \u0644\u0644\u0645\u0634\u0627\u0647\u062f\u0629\n\u0926\u0947\u0916\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0947 \u0932\u093f\u090f \u0927\u0928\u094d\u092f\u0935\u093e\u0926",

            "transcript": "  hello everyone and welcome to the Bitcoin section of the course in this section of the course we're going to be covering everything to do with bitcoins from what bitcoins are to how they work and all the way on to how you can basically use it for transactions on the Deep Web or the dark net so let's get started so in this video this is a basic introduction to what bitcoin is how it's used and what the current value is so let's get started so firstly you'll realize that bitcoin has a very nice logo I mean it just looks like a coin but with a bit bit basically the B means a bit so let's get started um coming on to understanding what a bitcoin is you have first have to understand that it has an abbreviation and that is BTC so let's basically let me basically explain what bitcoin is so bitcoin firstly is a decentralized currency which which essentially means that it's not a physical currency it's used on the internet so this is not it's not a currency that you can basically have physically it's a currency that is essentially what value on the internet or digitally alright so if today the internet were to collapse Bitcoin would also collapse with it and money as like money as today will not have any real value however it does have value because the internet is such a widely used to secondly it's the most preferred for payments on the dark web or the deep web and I think most of you guys already know this that it is the most preferred method of payment when coming to transactions on the deep web for the simple fact that it has the best anonymity in terms of how anonymous this payment is now you have to also have to understand that bitcoin is not completely anonymous all right it's not completely it's not really completely hidden behind any shadows however it is much more anonymous when compared to your credit card and I'm going to get you into basically Bitcoin mixing in the future videos in this section so let's go on until the final part here which is basically Bitcoin is a very erratic currency now let me explain what this means Bitcoin is highly volatile and unpredictable in the sense that it does not store value in a very predictable predictable fashion now you might be asking yourself well has bitcoins value always risen well yes that's true but it's always it has or sometimes gone down and that you know that really is dangerous in terms of people want to try and invest in it I will not recommend anyone to invest heavily into Bitcoin because it's really an it's really you can't really tell what the value is going to be a few years from now and we're going to get into that in a few minutes here now let's actually look at the bit some basic Bitcoin terminology you might have heard of the some of these terms if you're keen on behold Bitcoin scene so firstly you have your Bitcoin wallet alright now this is where your bitcoins will be stored for later use it's just your virtual wallet where you can store bitcoins all right this is unique to you and it's protected by you you have a password and that you you basically understand that this is your wallet where you can store your bitcoins of course it's a virtual wallet now secondly bitcoin address alright now this is basically an alphanumeric key that would be used to send and receive Bitcoin now this is your unique address that will be used for example if you want to pay someone on the idea on the Deep Web or the dark net you basically give them your bitcoin address and so on and so forth vice-versa now a blockchain this is really this isn't really important right now we will get into it well when we are talking about Bitcoin mining but basically a blockchain is a list of blocks which I'll explain what a block is and that has been mined since the start of cryptocurrency cryptocurrency now I'll get to that in a few minutes I promise probably in the next videos now let's look at what a Bitcoin ATM is now a Bitcoin ATM is the location where you can buy bitcoins with real money so this is where you exchange your money for example US Dollars that's an example or you can talk about the Great Britain per pound you can exchange that for Bitcoin alright so basically transferring as you guys know you're basically converting your currency into Bitcoin right and vice-versa now let's look at Bitcoin mining which is a very very hot topic right now and I'll probably cover a few videos on Bitcoin mining and how you can do it yourself so Bitcoin mining is the generation or production of bitcoins in the exchange for solving cryptographic problems using computer processing so basically if I were to set up a hypothetical Bitcoin miner this will include a computer obviously and essentially what your computer is going to be doing it's going to be using a lot of its processing power for solving these cryptographic problems and in exchange for your service you will be granted a certain amount of Bitcoin depending on the complexity of the cryptographic problem you are using I hope that wasn't too confusing but essentially Bitcoin mining is as most of you or as I'm guessing some of you may have heard is basically a just a cluster of computers connected together performing cryptographic problems in exchange for Bitcoin which in which later can be converted into real money so it is a money-making scheme now let's look at the Bitcoin value because I think it's very essential that we understand what I was pointing out earlier if we look as of recording this video the Bitcoin is a two thousand two hundred and eighteen point four seven US dollars that's one Bitcoin now if you pay attention to this little graph here it's going to tell you that Bitcoin started out almost at a zero value in 2013 all right now by the end of 2013 going on to 2014 it took the hugest spike I think in value and went up to I think a thousand one thousand one hundred and twenty dollars from not wrong if I kept up with that right and then all in basically in after two months it dropped all right a few hundred dollars and then climbed again and then it dropped and then it climbed again and then it went down by the end of 2014 and then it climbed again just at the beginning of 2015 and then declined very steadily I think up to hundred or two hundred dollars and then kept steady on throughout the entire 2015 the mid-and of 2015 onwards and then all the way to 2016 the beginning of 2016 it started climbing at a very steady rate almost like a tangent curve as you can see right here with a few hikes along the way and the highest value the highest peak I think that it's reached ever in history is basically very very recently in 2017 as you can see the value is not one two thousand dollars but what I was pointing out with how erratic it is is as you can see this graph does not make very sense and if you have to look at it in a mathematical or statistical point of view what I mean is if you guys are aware of statistics you will understand that this graph does not it's not a very good graph in terms of if you are investing in this currency for example because it goes up comes down goes up comes down very erratically it's not stable for a long period of time it would be acceptable if the value would be would keep on going but over the period of two years increase gradually with little or no spikes because that is very very threatening and you really can't tell what the future holds so that's basically it for this video guys if you have any questions just let me know in the community section of the course I'm going to be continuing in the next video about how to set up your Bitcoin address and your wallet for Bitcoin transactions so thank you so much for watching goodbye",

that's keen Bitcoin at gmail com so what is bitcoin bitcoin is a revolutionary technology that enables a new way to send payments over the internet you can think of it as an open accounting system where thousands of computers all over the world work together to track ownership of digital tokens called bitcoins when you send someone bitcoins the transaction is broadcast to the entire network after its verified it's recorded in a public ledger called the blockchain the block chain contains a record of every Bitcoin transaction that has occurred since the system began and it's shared and maintained on the network so everyone keeps the books so to speak most currencies are issued by a central authority that controls the money supply bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system so there is no central authority instead bitcoins are issued to users who help process transactions in the network this is known as Bitcoin mining Bitcoin miners are specialized computers that do the work required to verify and record transactions in the blockchain as a reward for their work the miners earn bitcoins and this is how new bitcoins are released into circulation the system is programmed so that only 21 million bitcoins will ever exist and as time goes by the mining reward decreases the result is a predictable supply that's governed by scarcity making bitcoins somewhat like a digital gold it's the first currency of the internet and everyone is free to use it with Bitcoin you can send any amount of money to anyone anywhere in the world as easily as sending an email what is bitcoin bitcoin is the first decentralized digital currency bitcoins our digital coins you can send through the internet compared to other alternatives bitcoins have a number of advantages bitcoins are transferred directly from person to person via the net without going through a bank or clearinghouse this means that the fees are much lower you can use them in every country your account cannot be frozen and there are no prerequisites or arbitrary limits let's look at how it works several currency exchanges exist where you can buy and sell bitcoins for dollars euros and more your bitcoins are kept in your digital wallet on your computer or mobile device sending bitcoins is as simple as sending an email and you can purchase anything with Bitcoin the Bitcoin network is secured by individuals called miners miners are rewarded newly generated bitcoins for verifying transactions after transactions are verified they are recorded in a transparent public ledger bitcoin opens up a whole new platform for innovation the software is completely open source and anyone can review the code bitcoin is changing finance the same way the web change publishing when everyone has access to a global market great ideas

additional business from the Bitcoin economy okay honey I'm on Bitcoin calm like you suggested and i'm starting to see why local businesses in keene are accepting it yeah I was talking with Chris today over at route 101 local goods and he told me that there's no fee to accept Bitcoin from customers so he keeps the full amount from each sale that's true but the positive impact of Bitcoin in our community is bigger than that people using Bitcoin locally means more money staying right here in the Keen area think about how much money your business sense to the credit card companies what is it three percent of every sale yeah it really adds up my business brought in around half a million dollars last year so three percent of that is fifteen thousand dollars that's money we could use to go on vacation or even give my employees a raise exactly you're starting to see the possibilities mhm that's pretty exciting how can I learn more about accepting Bitcoin in my business you can join keen

            "transcript": " There is currently a coin worth hundreds of dollars, but it is not from  Made of gold, or platinum, or any precious metal  In fact, it's not the kind of coin you can hold in your hand or there is a piggy bank.  It is a digital currency, which means it exists only in electronic form  I am talking about bitcoin  Bitcoin does not work like a common coin  It is not attached to the state or government, so it does not have a centralized distribution unit.  Or regulatory agency  Basically, this means that no organization can decide to issue more bitcoins or plans.  The quantity to be issued cannot track the flow of Bitcoin or investigate fraud  So how does Bitcoin, an electronic money, operate and value itself?  Simply put, Bitcoin needs a large group of people on the Internet and  Cryptography  In fact, Bitcoin is sometimes described as the world\u2019s first cryptocurrency  Here's how it works  Bitcoin is an all-digital currency. You can exchange bitcoin between computers.  Peer-to-peer network through the world  Most peer-to-peer networks are used to share files, like people  Download \"super legal\" music or movies  If Bitcoin is a digital currency, what can stop you from copying a bunch of counterfeit coins?  Then become super rich?  Honestly, this is not like MP3 music or video file bitcoin and a piece of data that can be copied.  Bitcoin actually exists in a huge book distributed around the world called the blockchain, the reason  We will talk about this in a minute.  The blockchain records every bitcoin transaction information that has occurred.  As of the end of 2016, the complete account has approximately 107 GB of data.  So, when you send someone some bitcoin, you are not giving them some  Instead, you actually wrote a record in that big book - similar:  \"Michael Hank sent 5 bitcoins\"  Now maybe you are thinking, \"But, etc.  You just said that Bitcoin does not have a centralized organization in charge of this information! \"  But even though the blockchain is a centralized record, there is no official unit.  Update the books and track everyone's money like a bank - this is the so-called decentralization  In fact, anyone can keep all the newly added transaction data on the blockchain.  And there are countless people doing this.  Bitcoin works because there are many people who have been confirming the information on the books to ensure  All transactions are correct  It\u2019s like, imagine that you are playing poker games with some good friends, but no one  Bring chips and cash at home  Everyone has no money, so several of you took out your notebook and started recording.  Who is betting, who wins, who loses  You can't trust each other completely, so everyone records their books separately.  At the end of each game, everyone took out their books and compare them.  In this way, if someone remembers the wrong account, or tries to deceive, secretly possess the money that is not their own.  This difference will be caught  After a few more games, you may have written a full page.  Mobile information  You can think of each page as a \"block\" of the transaction list.  In the end, your notebook will contain one page of trading information - that is, a continuous chain  Block  So called: blockchain  Now, if tens of thousands of people hold bitcoin blockchain copies, how?  Keep all your books in sync?  Think back to our poker analogy: try to imagine the entire bitcoin peer-to-peer network as  Millions of people sit at a very huge poker table  Some people just change money, but many volunteers just keep the books.  So when you want to send or receive money, you must post this information on the ledger to let everyone know  So everyone can update their books instantly  So in every transaction, you have to announce a few things to the Bitcoin network:  Your account number, the account number to receive Bitcoin, and  How many bitcoins are to be sent.  Then all the people who keep the blockchain will add a transaction to you.  In the current block  There are a bunch of people who are constantly watching the deal and it seems to be a pretty good security measure.  However, if you send Bitcoin, you need to disclose the account number at the same time.  This can become a security issue.  This is a big problem in the operation of common coins - think about criminals always trying  Stealing someone else's credit card information  And back to Bitcoin, there is no central bank to check suspicious fraud transactions at any time.  Like you suddenly spent your life savings in one  Beef jerky  So how do you prevent Hank from pretending to use my name?  Is my bitcoin out?  Thanks to cryptography for protecting Bitcoin well, which is why it is considered a cryptocurrency.  Specifically, Bitcoin can guarantee security because it has so-called keys, which are basically a piece of information.  Messages that can be used for mathematical method validation such as \"Hey, this  It\u2019s really a message from me! \u201d  When you create a bitcoin account, you may have heard of the so-called  A \"wallet\" that connects two unique keys: a private key  a public key  In this case, the private key can add some information and mark it. This action is also called  Sign so that others can follow up to verify these signatures  So if I want to send a message to the web like this: \"Michael sends 3  Bitcoin to Olivia.\"  At this point I signed this message with my private key. Only I can decrypt him, and no one.  This message can be copied.  Then, I send this signed message to the Bitcoin network, everyone can use my public key  Make sure my signature is sent.  In this case, everyone who is interested in Bitcoin trading will know the transaction that I want to post.  Join their blockchain copy.  In other words, if the public key can be successfully decrypted, this proves that the message was signed by my personal private key.  The message is indeed a message from me.  Different from handwritten signatures, or credit card numbers, this method of identity recognition  Cannot be forged by scammers  The \u201cwho\u201d part of each transaction is clearly the most important part to ensure the correct  Both parties can exchange bitcoin.  But the question about \"when\" is also important.  If your bank account has a thousand dollars and try to buy  Two banks of goods each worth 1,000 yuan will accept the first transaction and refuse  The second transaction.  If the bank does not do this, you can repeat the same amount of money.  This... sounds great, but it's also bad.  Such a financial system cannot function properly because no one will get the money.  So if I only have money to pay for one of Olivia or Hank, but I try to pay them both at the same time  The Bitcoin system has a check mechanism.  Whether it is the Bitcoin network or your wallet will automatically check your previous transactions to ensure  You have enough bitcoin to pay  But sometimes another time problem may occur  Because people around the world keep a copy of the blockchain, and the network  The delay time means that everyone will not always receive the published transaction information in the same order.  So now you have a bunch of people and a bunch of different pieces of information to choose  But they are not necessarily wrong  Ok, bitcoin  How do you solve this problem?  The answer is, really come to \"solve the problem\"  Mathematical problem  Every blockchain maintainer needs to solve the transaction information when adding it to the blockchain.  A special mathematical problem created by a hash function  A hash function is an algorithm that can be converted into a copy of any size.  Fixed size data output  For example, suppose you enter this string  And the hash function we used here says to add all the numbers together.  So in this case the output will be 10  The cryptographic strength of the hash function is when you give  When you type it, it's easy to figure out the result.  However, it is quite difficult to push back the original input data from the results.  Even in the super simple example, there are a lot of numbers that can add up.  The only way to find the original input is to always guess for '1-2-3-4' until you  Guess the correct set of numbers.  Now, the hash function used by Bitcoin is called SHA256, which stands for security hash.  The algorithm has a length of 256 bits.  It was originally developed by the US National Security Agency.  The computer that solves the SHA256 function problem is designed to require an average  I can guess a solution in about ten minutes.  This means that they need to go through millions of guesses before they can guess the answer.  Who can solve the problem of the hash function first, you can add blocks to the blockchain.  Then generate a new hash math problem that needs to be solved  If several people pick up the answer almost simultaneously, the network will choose one  The chain that continues to increase the block and becomes the longest is the most reliable blockchain.  Transaction information that exists in those other branch blockchains must be placed back in the trading pool.  Waiting to be added to the subsequent blockchain  Many volunteers spend thousands of dollars on special computers to solve these SHA256 problems.  And need to pay a very high electricity bill to keep these machines working.  But what is this for?  What makes them willing to come out and maintain the blockchain?  Is it just a community service?  In fact, the Bitcoin system has a built-in reward mechanism.  Now, every time you calculate a solution and add a new block to the blockchain, 12 and a half  The new Bitcoin will be created out of nothing and awarded to the bitcoin account that calculates the answer.  In fact, you may already know the aliases of these bitcoin book maintainers: miners  This is because people who have been trying to keep the blockchain constantly updating blocks are like waving crosses to the hash function.  Miners who hope to dig a large gold mine and get rich  When the Bitcoin system was first established in 2009, they actually had no real value.  Dozens of bitcoins were only about a pile of pennies at the time.  Now on November 10, 2016, 1 bitcoin can be exchanged for 708 USD.  Therefore, 12 and a half bitcoins are equivalent to $8,850.  This is a very big change  Every bitcoin is created to reward miners  In addition to the high bonus miners who each miner gets a new block, he can also  Receive a small transaction fee when placing each transaction in the block  It is also worth mentioning that the number of coins produced in each new block is generated every 210,000 blocks.  Will fall to half  So at the beginning, the reward for 50 bitcoin dropped to 25, then 12 and a half.  After a few years, there will be 6 rewards left and continue to decline.  In the end, there will be more and more transactions in the block so that the miners can still  Get paid for the transaction fee  According to current forecasts, the last bitcoin - probably the second one hundred and one hundred thousand  Coin - and will be produced in 2140  The design of Bitcoin\u2019s reduced amount is actually counterfeiting  Gold dug out of the soil  And the idea is that limiting Bitcoin\u2019s output will increase its value over time.  and so  Is investing in Bitcoin a good idea?  This...not the problem that SciShow will explore.  Bitcoin is still not stable enough and has some experimental nature  Many people like it, but many people think that it is doomed to fail.  We think this is an interesting idea that makes us curious about the possibility of password futurology  What changes have brought us  Thank you for watching this episode of SciShow.

            "transcript": " At the most basic level, Bitcoin is just a digital file or a book with names and balances.  People change the currency for currency exchange  When Bob sold the mower to Carol for 5.2 bitcoin  Bob's balance increased by 5.2, while Carol's balance decreased by 5.2.  There are no gold or government-issued currencies that support these numbers.  It\u2019s just that Bob is willing to sell his real-life mower in this digital file into a bigger number.  Because he believes that others trust the system as well.  So who will maintain the books and make sure there is no one cheating?  One of the goals of Bitcoin is to avoid any centralized control.  So each participant only needs to maintain the copy of his or her own ledger.  An amazing result is that everyone can see the balance of others  Although the real system only uses the number of the account number instead of the name, this also has some anonymity.  If everyone only maintains their own books, how do you keep the transfer of books in sync?  Basically, when you want to send bitcoin, you only need  Broadcast a message containing your account number, recipient, and transfer amount to others  After that, everyone in the world will update their books.  As a quick narration, I talked about how Bitcoin powers users who maintain books.  Even if you don't maintain a book, you can use the system to pay and collect money.  If the payment is simple, you can create a message with the account number.  How do you stop the thief Alice from spending his money by using Bob's account number?  Like pens and checks, Bitcoin also requires a signature from the account owner.  It's just based on math, not handwriting.  When creating a new account, a private key associated with this account will also be created.  If you have heard of the Bitcoin wallet, you will know what these private keys have saved.  It is also something that allows you to create a signature  To create a signature private key private key and transaction text is sent to a special encryption function  Another function allows others to check the signature  Make sure it is created by the account owner and applied to a specific transaction  Different from handwritten versions, these signatures cannot be copied and reused.  Because they are unique each time they are traded  Although digital signatures can prove who initiated the transfer, they can\u2019t prove when it\u2019s time to arrive.  It turns out that this is problematic.  In the traditional banking system, if Alice writes two checks but her money is only enough to pay for one of them  Then the bank will pay the first person who tries to cash her cheque.  The second one will be rejected because Alice\u2019s account is now empty.  Therefore, the order of these payments is crucial because it determines who should be paid.  Unfortunately, the order in Bitcoin is more difficult to detect than a single bank, and the books are spread all over the world.  Network latency can also cause  Transactions arrive in different places in different orders, and scammers can also fake their timestamps  Both bills believe that they are the first to arrive.  Effectively allowed Alice to spend the same amount of money twice!  In order to prevent this from happening  Bitcoin provides a way for the entire world to determine the order of transactions  When a new transaction is created, they enter the transaction pool to be processed.  Here they will be arranged on a huge chain to lock their order  A mathematical lottery method to decide which transaction is the next  Participants choose their favorite pending transactions and start trying to solve a particular problem  Link it to the end of the chain. The first person found a solution to win,  Their transaction will be the next transaction on the chain  So, is there any problem with this link? It is based on a special function called a hash password.  It\u2019s as scary as it sounds. It just confuses the input and spits out a bunch of numbers.  This is especially because it is irreversible and there is no easy way to start with the output.  To guess what is being input to output this result can only cost a huge amount of computation to guess  This is literally done by people in Bitcoin to randomize this function.  Until the output meets certain conditions  In addition to random guessing you can also enter a transaction from the suspended pool and chain  This is where the link part is.  So the lottery mechanism provides the entire world with a way to decide on the next transaction.  But the math behind it also helps to ensure that everyone agrees to past transactions.  Suppose you are joining the network for the first time and request a copy of the transaction chain.  But will you receive a few different versions which one should you trust?  Ideally, you will trust the majority of people who are using it.  But to determine if it is very difficult on the Internet, can you not let a person vote millions of times?  Bitcoin blocks this by asking people to solve math problems and vote.  This leads to a cost per calculation for a single person or group  It is impossible to surpass or exceed the computing power of most users  The transaction sorting process described previously actually provides a voting system.  Part of the link question input is a transaction from the end of the chain  So every guess is a vote on the chain. But what about all the votes?  Because the cryptographic hash function has a good definition of statistical properties  You can view any given answer and estimate how much guess you need  Just like how many coins need to be turned over for 100 consecutive fronts  So the links in the chain not only make the transaction orderly but also serve as an effective way to vote.  Make it easy to see which link most people use.  Finally, how did the money come about? Every time someone wins in the lottery algorithm of the next transaction  New Bitcoins are created and awarded to their account  The act of solving these problems is often called \"mining\", which is equivalent to money entering the system.  But the main purpose of this math is to ensure everyone\u2019s ledger confirmation  Mathematics provides a convenient way to randomly distribute money to the world.  In fact, about 2140 years or so, no mine can be dug. Participants will only be able to get the billing fee from the transaction.

            "title": "Own Bitcoin With Little Downside Risk - BTC Options Introduction",
            "transcript": "  hello crypto wizards Shaun here and we are looking at some pretty unprecedented price action movement on Bitcoin at the moment I mean we've been from like $3,000 mid September to what 7600 on the fifth of November now trading at about 7,200 so the price action is absolutely mad at the moment now you might be looking to get in on Bitcoin and what I wanted to talk about is how to significantly reduce your risk in entering a trade and buy yourself time to see what happens with the price whilst owning Bitcoin now normally what you would see happen if you bought bitcoins so I'm gonna just go to one of my tools over here if I buy a Bitcoin right now at today's price if the price moves down I lose money if the price goes up I'll make money straightforward well what if we wanted to protect this downside so that if the price goes down you only lose a certain amount of money think of it like car insurance you buy insurance for your car and you have an accident and there's like five grands worth of repairs to do but your ex's is only $200 your maximum risk is $200 plus whatever you paid for that insurance an option is kinda similar and that's what we want to talk about here is buying an option to protect your downside so what is an option on investopedia an option is a financial derivative that represents a contract sold by one party the option rights are to another party the option holder the contract offers the buyer the right but not the obligation to buy or sell a security or another financial asset and agree at an agreed-upon price the strike price during a certain period of time or at a specific date known as the exercise day blah blah blah what does that actually mean so let's say that I give you the right to sell Bitcoin between now and the 24th of December at a certain price let's call $7,500 so the more the price would move with Bitcoin the higher the value of that option because if I'm allowed to sell at this price and the price is moving down the value of that contract between us is increasing and that's exactly what I wanted to talk about over here so for example let's say we're not going to buy any coin let's say we're going to buy a put option and we're gonna buy it at yeah $7,500 this is how a put option works now a put makes money when the price goes down if you buy a put a call option makes money if the price goes up now right now we're gonna look at the price moving down I know that you're bullish but we're going to come to that in a second let's say the price moves down the put option as I was just explaining makes money you your profit increases as the price moves down let's say the price moves up well your profit decreases now interestingly you want to hold some coin and what happens when the price of that coin goes up as we saw earlier you make money so let's enter in two transactions here the first is we're going to buy this insurance we're going to buy this put option with a strike price 7,500 dollars for an agreed date of December the 24th as the expiry date and let's say now we want to buy some coin this is what your profit and loss scenario would now look like and so in this trading tool over here it allows us to see into the future essentially what would our profit be determining depending on what happens with the price as you can see here if the price Rockets up your profit is unlimited I mean if Bitcoin goes to $15,000 you're going to make a ton of money if it goes to $10,000 you're going to make two-and-a-half grand just owning one Bitcoin but your loss is capped at $500 now that's kind of interesting because before when we looked at this without buying that insurance your loss was not kept it could go to zero and you could lose all your money but now you've bought some insurance so if we enter into that contract we have the insurance and it's a very safe way to enter into owning Bitcoin so I hope you found that useful there's going to be a lot more videos on options because nobody is talking about this Bitcoin is highly volatile and you can make money no matter which way the price moves I'll give you a quick example of that now let's say we don't own any point we buy one put and we buy one call both at the same strike price you can see that no matter which way the price moves you make profit and you lose money if the price doesn't move now the nice thing about this and the nice thing about options is you have time even though the option loses value over time the market changes over time the Bitcoin price will do different things over time and it allows you to buy time to let the price do its thing rather than entering into a trade where you have your resistance line here and your support line here next thing you know the price plummets over there you've lost money you've cut out of your stop you're upset because you didn't have the time only then to see the next thing happened the price rockets up and you're really annoyed so this is a really good way in a safe way to enter into buying Bitcoin and we'll talk about in some other videos how you can actually do this what are the exchanges that allow you to buy options what's happening with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange what's happening with the futures market why you should care and why you need to get knowledgeable on that so I hope you found this useful and if you have any questions just head over to crypto wizards net and ping me a message or two and we can we can answer any questions you have either online or over video so thanks a lot for watching and take care [Music]",

            "description": "#ONLINEACADEMY\n\nWhat is Bitcoin | ( BTC-2017 ) Presentation  ?\n\nBitcoin is a cryptocurrency and a payment system invented by an unidentified programmer, or group of programmers, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. Bitcoin was introduced on 31 October 2008 to a cryptography mailing list, and released as open-source software in 2009. There have been various claims and speculation concerning the identity of Nakamoto, none of which are confirmed. The system is peer-to-peer and transactions take place between users directly, without an intermediary. These transactions are verified by network nodes and recorded in a public distributed ledger called the blockchain, which uses bitcoin as its unit of account. Since the system works without a central repository or single administrator, the U.S. Treasury categorizes bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency. Bitcoin is often called the first cryptocurrency although prior systems existed[note and it is more correctly described as the first decentralized digital currency. Bitcoin is the largest of its kind in terms of total market value.\n\nEarn Bitcon Link Below :\nSig Up and Earn Per Day 45,000\n1).https://goo.gl/0GRV7p\n2).https://goo.gl/DSqI0x\n3).https://goo.gl/vKHTS3\n4).https://goo.gl/oLIGNw\n5).https://goo.gl/v61W6H\n\n\u25baThe BITCOIN Complete Conference PART 1\n     https://goo.gl/KFP8ha\n\n\u25baThe BITCOIN Complete Conference PART 2\n     https://goo.gl/QbIcvD\n\n\u25baThe BITCOIN Complete Conference PART 3\n     https://goo.gl/9K92BP\n\n\u25baThe BITCOIN Complete Conference PART 4\n     https://goo.gl/iPh51l\n\n\u25baThe BITCOIN Complete Conference PART 5\n     https://goo.gl/4rJj4n\n\n\n\u25baHow to make money online?\n    https://goo.gl/lhOhqm\n\n\u25baExchange BTC:\n    Contact :\n    Email            :  onlineacademy750@gmail.com\n    Cell               :  +92 310 1210855",

Tom's company went bankrupt by 1998 by this time the Internet had spread to over a quarter of US homes multiple digital currencies came in weds government regulation caused currencies like eagled gold money and Liberty Reserve to cease progress no digital currency created yet was safe from censorship during the course of this inquiry we've examined the issues and potential risks and threats that virtual currencies posed and came 2009 bitcoin is the first virtual currency to not have a central point of failure most importantly it is resistant to government force Bitcoin protect your privacy access its entire system is distributed and thus impossible to pinpoint and shut down if the United States wants to block money from going to WikiLeaks where they go while they go to PayPal Visa MasterCard - the world put pressure on them there with Bitcoin there's none of that there's nobody in the middle - to go after it is able to achieve this feat through cryptography which is basically a fancy word for secure communication the software of course takes place via the internet as it was designed a distributed network of voluntary users provides the service to maintain the Bitcoin software system this currency allows you to send a payment to anyone in the world online without using any bank company country governments were otherwise trusted third-party sending Bitcoin basically works like an email except that a bitcoins unit of value cannot be duplicated only a specified number of Bitcoin units will ever be in existence much unlike the US dollar money supply which is determined by the Federal Reserve central bank America's money supply has basically doubled in just the past decade causing prices of goods and services to do the same after it was released the first bitcoins had near zero value because at this time almost all the users were simply cryptography enthusiasts computer nerds playing around with some new and cool piece of software by May 2010 Bitcoin was beginning to trade in the real world it is likely the first transaction ever made with the fledgling currency which began in 2009 this Papa John's Pizza might look like an ordinary delivery but it seems likely to go down in history is most expensive food of all time a member pleaded to the community for someone to provide him with two pizzas delivered to his residence for his payment of 10,000 points this simple dinner and perhaps a little leftovers cost the equivalent in bitcoins of what would come to be worth over 10 million dollars by December 2013 this is how fast bitcoin has increased in value or rather how fast the increase in its number of users and recognition has been much of a kind of company can even credit design on Christmas unified mechanics to learn as you go Tommy fizzy for Christmas hai-yah online exchanges have been providing the trade of bitcoins and dollars for years though many have closed from site security issues and lack of complying with government regulations Bitcoin pirate scandal SEC steps in amid allegations that the whole thing was a Ponzi scheme mass adoption however will more easily happen from a recent trend that is growing fast now if you haven't heard of Bitcoin yet it is making international headlines and changing the way we exchange money it is the first of its kind in the world and today the Bitcoin ATM was unveiled right here in San Diego Bitcoin ATMs are deploying worldwide allowing the sale of bitcoins for cash and cash into bitcoins at physical locations this machine changes it all by allowing users to get cash out or make deposits to their accounts there are already such machines in Boston Massachusetts Austin Texas Mountain View California Vancouver Canada and Tijuana Mexico bitcoin is like the Internet in 1994 few people used it and even fewer knew how it worked but it would go on to revolutionize nearly every industry in the world digital currencies are set to revolutionize money bitcoin is such a versatile software that hundreds of copycats spin-offs have already been created including litecoin dogecoin and even Aurora coin the cryptocurrency introduced and this tributed equally to all citizens of Iceland it appears that 2014 is the year of Bitcoin and digital currency the future you know I really think digital currency is more about freedom and if you have your your own wealth and control your own wealth it's about freedom not about anything other than that really we'd like to give you a free report on Bitcoin and digital currencies go sign up and crush the street comm backslash Bitcoin to download this report this report will give you more on the history how to use it and why you should use Bitcoin to have more control over your wealth",

            "transcript": "  ladies and gentlemen let's take a seat tonight is going to be a very special evening and I know what you're all waiting for and the reason this is going to be a very special evening is that we've been able to invite the two leading heads from NJ and n chain is the leading research and development company in the block chain business now this event is unique because we've also asked two of our favorite professors to come and join us and discuss questions which are interesting to academia but which are also interesting to you Thank You Sebastian welcome everybody to xt university if you've travelled from far away i saw some people on the list have come from cardiff bristol craig himself as driven here from London it's a huge privilege and honor to have Craig and Jimmy here this evening and we really look forward to the presentations and the debate that's going to happen after that so for me the bitcoin story goes right back to when it all first started I've been a lecturer here at the University for quite a long time now I was teaching macroeconomics and you know the topic of money always comes up what is money history of money for me Bitcoin was just a small curious thing that was developing and it's been incredible to watch how its unfolded it's been an incredible success up to now but that's the sort of thing that we're going to be discussing later so I want to really make sure this happens so we don't run out of time I want to say thank you it's Alisa Harris in our digital learning team at the University in the business school thank you to her for helping us prepare for this events Margaret has used your hedge have also been helping us a lot and David berry provided the money to fund it so thank you to him as well we've got volunteer students who are helping this evening here's the list of names from the economic society Matti foldy Abbey Cena Bela record Renato against David Nolan and Nick butcher had been moths now Cody thank you so much guys to help make sure things went smoothly so we did the last year to tell us how much you know about blockchain and Bitcoin these are the results and this is good because that means we actually serve a purpose of giving an introduction here and there are also some experts here so people who are crypto fanatics might be looking in the break for those experts in order to get get into the the arena so to be honest with ourselves you know the question can you explain to explain this to your grandmother or a loved one royal a small child to be honest we're not sure whether we ourselves will be able to do that at this stage so the the aim of today is not to be able to answer all the questions the aim of today is to be able to ask questions you might not have looked at before and the beautiful thing about today is we are hive we have the two people who can answer all the questions you have today so when me and Sebastian were talking about how to introduce this session one of the things we wanted to do was from our perspective just share our thoughts on exactly that you know how do you explain Bitcoin even if you're an expert to people that don't really know anything about it it's actually quite a challenge and I'm sure people might disagree with this but the foot the first starting point for me is to tell people that Bitcoin isn't really a coin you know obviously that helps you understand that it's a form of money it's a new form of money that's true but I was talking to somebody the other day and she was asking me you know is they are there physical bitcoins can I can I go and get these things so obviously there's this kind of mental barrier in terms of accepting that it's you know digital money first of all but the most subtle thing of course is is the mining itself which which is the process of making sure that the public ledger and that ultimately is what bitcoin is it's a safe secure completely verified and unbreakable public ledger the might that the miners actually ensure agrees over time so yes it's a bit like gold mining but in some sense it's not a very helpful analogy so I want to walk through an example of three people carrying out economic activity and carrying out some transactions just as a way of starting this process of explaining to somebody who doesn't know anything about Bitcoin what the hell is it so you're using pound sterling here we've got Mike he's he's a painter he's doing some work for Kate's friend has three hours of babysitting for Mike and Kate's selling wedding wedding photos so normally people might if it's the informal economy they might just exchange physical cash if it's more formal we might actually use our banks these debit cards whatever there'll be a process of transferring money to each other so if we look at their account balance at the starts right what happens after transaction number one well Kate pays Michael hundred pounds that's transaction one we're updating a ledger here guys so we're adding a hundred pounds to Mike's accounts and we're taking away a hundred pounds from Kate's account with me so second transaction fifty pounds transfers this time from Mike sir Fran Rach he's done some work for him third transaction 30 pounds transfers to Kate and again we have to update the ledger so banks central banks normally carrying out this process Bitcoin is a way of doing all of this without using banks and central banks so money is a process of updating a ledger in the case of Bitcoin it's a public ledger so I'm going to explain what what that means we could have done all of what we just did just now not using but using bitcoins or Bitcoin cash in this case just I just put an exchange rate here of a thousand bitcoins to one pound just just to show you that it's the same process so we would just be updating our Ledger's and in exactly the same way okay now an important part of how Bitcoin works is that everybody has the same ledger that has every single transaction available to everybody and they're and they can all keep a record of it and it's shared it's distributed right normally banks centralize this they store it they keep it safe or maybe they don't keep it safe but they they try and keep it safe bitcoin is completely transparent in the sense of the ledger being public and the ledger is updating over time in this case for that first transaction we've got the same process unfolding so after transaction one that's what's happened now everybody has the same ledger and a question starts to arise what if there's some nasty people out there and what if we're doing trade with millions billions of people around the world what if mike actually tries to cheat the system what if everybody recognizes that he has about not point five bitcoins and he tries to pay fran and he tries to pay kate at the same time he might try and pay them not point five at the same time and if they'd written down the ledger on paper and if they hadn't had time to update it in between one transaction then he could double spend he could spend those not point five units simultaneously and he would be cheating and the whole system would break down the innovation that Satoshi Nakamoto introduced in his white paper was fundamentally to solve the double spending problem that I've just explained in addition to other problems that's really the genius of the whole thing so before I hand back to Sebastian another practical aspect to how Bitcoin works if you're trying to explain it to your proverbial grandmother is to say that there's something called a public key and you own a private key but the public key is really just let your bank account number right here in the UK we're used to having a sort code and an account number it's the way that years an individual at being identified right so when people set up a wallet for you using any of the cryptocurrencies it creates a tag which identifies who you are so again this is nice this is working the same way that people are used to working in normal setting okay so let's get a sense of how big coin works and why does it work anyway and what is the mechanism what does blockchain mean right so they're two key ingredients that's the way I look at it and these have existed before Bitcoin but none of them got it to work none of them succeeded because they couldn't get rid of the double spending problem that Jack mentioned they always ended up with with a central authority or a third party that had to be incorruptible there was always a chance this party could be corrupted so and then Bitcoin game and all of a sudden it started working so what are those key ingredients that made the difference and that made Bitcoin what it is today so one aspect of it is the mechanism of digital signatures it's very simple it's make it's basically the private key in the public key and with the private key and a predefined hash function you generate a value that is associated with the public key and this public key only it means that when I'm signing a transaction or any message for that matter anybody is able to verify whether I'm indeed the owner of that public key by matching it with the generated value of the hashing function you can think of this as a door lock but with two keys and one key can only open it the other one can only close it so when the owner opens the door and you're able to close it again you know you've got the right man so when I'm sending electronic coins I'm really just sending information that belongs to me that I'm holding this amount of coins so for any transaction I'm verifying that the coins actually belong to me and I'm passing on the ownership of those coins by adding my signature to the public address of the receiver all this information is stored in a hash and kept in a block and add it on to the blockchain it's a database it's that simple who keeps the database secure well that's what the miners come in so this is where to me the key innovation occurred so let me try to explain this with an analogy imagine you're a group of people and you all have your own news outlet now your business you want to make money and the sooner you broadcast your news the more money you make right because if you're the first one who tells a story and you're incentivized enough to bring it out there immediately people can say you must be the first witness and so your version of the story must be correct so they give you credit for your story a similar thing happens in mining and the toilet that the story you're telling as a miner is the story of how you solve the mathematical puzzle and the puzzle was so difficult to solve and in fact you're so proud of it you want to show everyone in the network what you did but you ain't doing this for fun remember you want to get paid and there are two sources of income to you the transaction fee that anyone is paying when you may accept transaction and although it's voluntary you can adjust that transaction fee the miner would not probably not accept the transaction fee where he knows he's gonna bankrupt himself so you probably said it a reasonable I know just below penny a transaction fee that gives the minor incentive to mind you and the second reward is the creation of new bits of coins at least for for a while now and you know if this looks confusing to you you know I need my notes too sir you can tell this is not an easy process to explain to anyone but the key is that the network has to find a system of consensus this is called proof of work and this is the key to the system this is the innovation now see you can't just make up a story and be to be able to verify the next block of transaction first you need to show the network that the signatures use the valid so you can't just send money around am ii remember the story of the mathematical puzzle you want to show so this is your proof of work this is the consensus mechanism in the network without it the participants in the network I'm not going to let you have that reward so when you try and validate a transaction in or any amount of transactions in the next block and you don't fulfill those conditions then other miners are gonna what they call often your block so you're the only one adding blocks to a chain there is no longer accepted so your reward won't be worth anything either so what do you do you stick to the rules of the game now the puzzle you're trying to solve is no easy thing and it becomes a competitive system and the most powerful computers in the world are able to be in that race for the next block any computer that is powerful can do that it is brutal free-market capitalism at its best I mean talk about security so you end up having something like that now this is a new complete graph for a small world and forget the little ones here these are the nodes right so what happens when one of those nodes are gone the net weight doesn't care because they're enough right and they're so interconnected in fact it doesn't take long for that if this one discovers a transaction it's broadcast of the whole network right and this happens within milliseconds so if you try to double spend you got the timestamp server that says well it's already it's already here what you're doing it's not the valid transaction it's the first one got in it spread so quickly it's interconnected so much it's it's there within milliseconds and I mean the amount of hops craig taught me today it takes four networks you go to all the to all the other nodes is about 1.4 1.3 so the Internet is nothing like it the Internet's highly centralized some of you may be thinking but don't you need the Internet to connect to the network the answer is no you need a communication platform that can send signals and information to the network to the blockchain so you can send coins via SMS today there's context for that and there are other exciting things coming up so you know if what does this mean for us for an economy what are the broader implications well first of all it's an irreversible system right Bitcoin has solved the double spending problem there are no reverse payments there is no central authority that could be corrupted and I mean you can sense this when you buy a flight ticket and you have to try the chance to be the option of paying the direct transfer or pair credit card and the credit card souls always more expensive right now the reason for that is you can reverse payments there's a 20 20 days window or something where you can actually where the company you're paying is not entirely sure whether that payment is going to arrive or not this is a time factor and the cost factor in economics for any business so Yuri Bitcoin has just gotten rid of that and this is very important coins won't be mined until infinity it's built into the consensus mechanism it gets more and more difficult to mine coins because so essentially there is a limited supply of coins and that is actually no so you know think about that you you can't just lower interest rates as a central bank and lend money that you don't have so you know we could effectively prevent crashes to create extent it's all it's all transparent and the question really is you know well we're not going to have bubble okay it's pretty cool but it's the long term perspective is it well not just I mean this is what I looked at in my dissertation and I looked at blockchain applications in underdeveloped countries and people there are people in rural Kenya in western Kenya that are not able to get a bank account because if they need to have over $200 to be able to open one and they it costs them six dollars to withdraw so if they get access to even a feature phone and people a lot of people in Kenya are using in paisa so they do have it they're able to open a mobile wallet practically for free and there's no one on earth that needs to give them permission in order to transact with anyone around the planet isn't that so we will have 20 minutes break or let's say 25 25 minutes we'll all meet back here at 6:20 to welcome our experts Jimmy and Craig everyone thank you [Applause]",

            "transcript": "  hey guys it's great to be back in Cape Town so I'm here today to talk about Bitcoin and the future of this interesting piece of technology so I'm sure everyone's heard varying things and have different levels of knowledge on Bitcoin and I want to clarify a few things upfront first of all I don't work for Bitcoin nobody works with Bitcoin it's a piece of software it's not a company and a lot of people think that the shares are traded they're not they're actually the units of Bitcoin that are traded on various exchanges it's also it's very interesting technology because as much as you think it's not traceable and anonymous as a currency it's actually way more traceable than cash and and so people are talking about Bitcoin being the future of money so I want to talk a little bit about the history of money and work us into you know discussion of where Bitcoin could go so if you look at one of the biggest social problems out there is its trust right Trust doesn't scale a scale very well and that's because you can trust the people around you your family your friends but as it gets you know wider and wider into society you need things like institutions law contracts just in order to make sure you feel comfortable doing transactions so when we have this problem that we're trying to solve with scaling and you look at how we've done it as a society in the past we've used things like gold to scale and and gold is basically backed by money and banks and well might eventually the gold went away and then the banks had crises which 2008-2009 financial crisis you saw banks basically needing to be bailed up because they didn't have anything to back the notes that they issued you've also had governments being hacked and personal data being thrown all over the place in recent months so we have a trust problem in society and so what are the hopes around Bitcoin is that can come by using math and algorithms can we solve some of these problems so what is money exactly and so I like to think of money as commoditized trust you know if you think back 500 years thousand years we didn't trust each other obviously so when we had the barter system where you would swap your bread for milk for leather for any other goods it was really hard to keep track of who owed what to who especially when you were producing excess amounts of one or one commodity or another or one piece of good versus another and so gold became a store of value gold is interesting because it's a fixed commodity there's only a certain amount of gold in the world that's been created over the millions of years ts been around so and there's a certain supply that comes in certain amount of gold that gets mined every single year it's very stable in that sense and over hundreds of years it's been trusted as a store value and people have used it in so we had this situation where we're starting to trust people in society we decided to start trusting something versus people and you know over time that changed because gold is not scalable you know you don't walk around with bars of gold when you want to buy a house or it's just it gets kind of heavy right so so what do we do we locked it up in bank vaults we gave it to the banks we gave it a government's and we said you guys store the gold give us a piece of paper which kind of tells us that the gold is there we hope that's a bit of a black box right because you don't know the gold is there not and in fact most many in most countries have moved away from the gold standard so well the notes that you're holding today don't represent gold anymore they just don't and this is where we have the financial crisis of 2008 is over-leveraged banks and financial institutions so we were taught to trust someone or an institution and so in 2008 a group of programmers or one we're not sure came up with the concept of Bitcoin and they wrote the software and they open sourced it which basically means that the code is there for anyone in the world to have a look at and inspect and so the base computer scientists the best mathematicians they've all been looking at this code for years and bitcoins had some ups and downs in the past but it's gotten the point now in the past two or three years it's a you know do use what unhackable is probably a bad explanation of what it is because it's actually not something which can be hacked and the mathematical algorithms are going to Bitcoin are actually very sick especially when you have millions of computers now putting computing power into it so we've gotten to a point where we've moved from a physical commodity to something which is a digital commodity and I'll explain more about that in a second but you know just bear with me we're going to see we can use math to solve the trust issues in society so what exactly is a Bitcoin well it's it's a unit of measure so in your mind picture this imagine you had a spreadsheet with 21 million cells in that spreadsheet okay and each cell can only be owned by one person at one point in time okay oh and you can obviously own multiple cells now that's a novel concept I imagine if that spreadsheet was live on the internet and everyone can see what is in those cells and each cell could hold a hundred million pieces of information now that's basically what the Bitcoin network is it's this huge piece of information which sits on what we call a public ledger and so when you make a transaction it's public what happens to that cell who gets transferred to how it moves wrong that's public and you cannot you cannot fake a transfer because it's all time-stamped and it's it's it's processed by millions of computers so so take that aside for a if all the cells are exactly the same then it's a commodity because they're the homogeneous right every single cells the same they can hold 100 million now what's that worth something what can we use it for many things and I think we're still at the very early stages of what we can do with this I'll talk about some of the examples in a second but fundamentally the one problem it solves better than any other software solution over the past couple years is the double spin problem which is if I give a Bitcoin to somebody and that Bitcoin is worth $250 and that person receives it I cannot transfer that sell to anyone else because the position has changed and a million computers have confirmed it in order to fake that you'd need another million computers which is not very feasible you know in the current world that we're in with Bitcoin so it solves elegantly what they call the double spin and if you think about the music industry today you copy a music file you can give it a hundred people there's no tracking of it there's no way anyone can stop that in the Bitcoin network it can be stopped and you prevent people from double spending so that's novel so now you've got 20 1 million of these commoditize units of currency because like gold it could be announcer 3 a bar of gold could be a sell what is that worth and how can we turn that into a currency or how can we use it for other further things so Bitcoin has gone through a lot of speculation in the past couple of years it's start of being something which was relatively cheap pennies it was very flat you know this is the price chart of Bitcoin so far it was flat for a while a couple of spikes here and there but about you know 2013 all of a sudden the world started waking up to what bitcoin is about what it can be useful primarily as a currency so we saw the crisis in malta banks shining down banks taking money other people's account and people started buying into into Bitcoin as a alternative currency and interesting enough you can transfer bitcoins over the internet you can't exactly you know transfer gold over the Internet so because it's limited it has value and speculators are basically going in and figuring out the price so what they did was they ran the price up to about a thousand bucks per Bitcoin in 2000 and 2013 in 2013 and it's come down since so the prices had a field day you know one minute is up you know 50 times in the year the other down 75% and so it's Bitcoin is in the in the eyes of the media died about 72 times according to Bitcoin obituaries calm who tracks what the press is saying about Bitcoin but what's interesting to me is when you see the growth in interest in Bitcoin from developers it's there's more interest in Bitcoin than in a part of like PayPal and the growth is astounding they're more people trying to figure out how to use Bitcoin then pretty much any other payment technology out there and I'm when I say trying to figure out no one knows ok we don't know what we're going to use this thing for we know it's very cool and interesting to have a public ledger and I'll show you an example of what our industry is doing with a public ledger but it it's it's really something where the use case of Bitcoin is yet to be solved it's sort of like the internet 94 we didn't know exactly how we be using it but we knew there was something there which brings it to my next point if you look at the first comms okay and how there was a huge interest and then kind of society and everyone believed well you know it's all over yeah that's that's the stock price of a very famous comm company where went through the roof kind of collapsed everyone believed well this thing's not going to take off anyway people calling for you know the CEO to shut the company down this year to get fired etcetera etcetera stop raising money and you know if you look at where amazon.com is today I think we can agree that the highs of the dot-com have been surprised I think five or six times at least so you just need to have a long term view on technology because these things don't play out of a couple of months it plays out over years especially with the collective efforts of thousands of the world's smartest people it's going into a part of technology like Bitcoin they're going to solve the problems they're going to find use cases around Bitcoin and so I just want to draw the analogy to where the current prices say it's actually very similar and this is not because this is a this is psychological issue okay this is speculation which would happen in a pre-2000 and the psychology of technology people don't feel you know if it doesn't solve a problem right now it's not valuable right now that's kind of how how the world thinks about things sometimes so in in the gift card industry which I'm I'm in we're looking at how do we use the blockchain to store information so that's cell with 100 million units of information how can we use it and so one of the challenge in our industry right now is that as gift card codes move from one person to another they get compromised so how do you store it securely and every time it moves to different person the code would change and therefore the codes aren't compromised and so we store that with Bitcoin we can effect to remove those codes around and we could help alleviate fraud and fift and so that's just one example but there are many others there's identity you know the guys that are then a 22 when you're working with Lucy Liu to help solve the problem of kids who are you know left stranded aboard of you know from child trafficking how do you give them identity how do you store that securely online somewhere how do you make sure that that that identity travels with that child wherever they go how does how do they rescue kids financial assets how do you store financial assets in the blockchain the blockchain is basically the chain and it has the list of all the transactions in the history of Bitcoin so the blockchain today as every transaction ever made on Bitcoin is in the blockchain today you can go back six years and millions of transactions and so there's governance issues there's there's no tree think about it this way because every single Tron's actually is time-stamped you can actually use it to notarize digital information as well and these products and solutions are me both are today so you know there's a lot that's happening in Bitcoin a lot more than I can cover now but if you are interested at all I suggest you you know buy some bitcoins by you know two hundred hands worth twenty dollars whatever it is and just try and spend online try and get an experience of it because I think I believe today we're at the starting point at the infancy of where this technology is going and if you want to feel if you feel this is a big enough idea and that's what we're here for you should expose yourself to it thank",

hope this three-and-a-half hour course will provide one of the fastest ways possible to get up to speed the course gets a little technical and is mostly targeted at developers but I try to stay at the concept level for the most part and hope it will also be insightful for people that just want to learn more in general about blockchain technology and its potential applications here's a quick summary of the course contents there are four modules starting with an introduction to Bitcoin concepts and basic usage including how to get it store it and the question of why it has any value at all the second module follows with a look under the hood to get tangible insight into how it works the third module explains the latest features in Bitcoin like segregated witnesses and lightning networks and also some of the challenges like the capacity concerns the block size debate and how to address those with hard or soft Forks the fourth module survey is a number of promising decentralized projects beyond Bitcoin including important alt coins like Manero - light coin and also non currency projects like aetherium prediction markets private blockchains IOT identity and storage related applications like IP FS I do have to warn you that Pluralsight is Pei walled but you can get a free trial to watch two hundred minutes of this 210 minute course I'll also be posting several demo excerpts from the course including how to use hardware wallets like treasurer how to create in broadcast a transaction programmatically with the bit core JavaScript library and how to create and use aetherium contracts the rest of this video will go into more detail about the course contents the first module is designed to get beginners up to speed on both the concepts and basic use of Bitcoin it begins with the big ideas behind Bitcoin like privacy openness and programmability and attempts to explain why bitcoins have value it then follows with several demos showing how to use Bitcoin starting with how to get it from exchanges in person to at ATMs to how to spend it on a website with a mobile phone accept it on your own website as payment and finally how to securely store it in a hardware wallet or in cold storage with a paper wallet the second module dives into how Bitcoin works under the hood explaining the key foundational concepts that underlie Bitcoin like digital signatures and cryptographic hashes and how those are used to create transactions and secure the blockchain I use the JavaScript library called bit core to show you how to programmatically make an address and send a transaction I answer some questions like what keeps the people running the Bitcoin network from stealing your money and how is it that you can create a new Bitcoin address without checking to see if someone else hasn't already used it the module also includes information about mining double spend attacks and SPV wallets which is how you can trust mobile phone wallets the third module goes over the latest and upcoming features in Bitcoin starting with HD wallets or hierarchical deterministic wallets and how they make it possible to backup a wallet with 12 words which by the way if you memorize gives you a bringing wallet it then covers multi signature addresses that require two of three people to spend funds including real demos using the COPE a wallet trustless escrow operations using multi signatures are covered next consider that when you send Bitcoin online it's completely irreversible so without an escrow service it would be very easy for a seller to take your money and never ship a product I review the current concerns with Bitcoin including the block size debate capacity limitations and centralization pressures that seem to be threatening the very purpose of Bitcoin decentralization I talked about how fixes to these concerns might be implemented with soft or hard forks and the pros and cons of those routes I give an overview of the latest new features like segregated witnesses which might help with the capacity and block size debate check lock time verify and replace by fee payment channels and lightning networks which may increase capacity by orders of magnitude and finally payment protocols that make online payments more secure in the coin joint protocol that can improve privacy the fourth module goes beyond Bitcoin to talk about important all coins and mini decentralized projects that aren't currencies at all the module begins with some suggestions for how to compare all these different systems explains the difference between all coins medic owns and sidechains and answers questions like why aren't all these new ideas just being directly added to Bitcoin I then survey alternatives to proof of work the linchpin idea behind Bitcoin that allows anonymous strangers to reach consensus while incredibly elegant many criticize the energy required and the centralization pressures it creates I then give a thorough introduction to proof of stake the leading alternative to proof of work explaining how it works and it's lingering questions next the module talks about private or permission block chains or ones that aren't completely open these are being experimented with by banks corporations and even governments I attempt to answer the question is a private blockchain any different or better than a distributed database in speaking of databases I cover tender mint ripple and big chain DB 3 systems that strive to vastly improve the performance of Bitcoin by utilizing the results of decades of distributed database research moving on the course discusses new systems that aim to improve privacy including Manero ring signatures stealth addresses and zero knowledge proves with zero cash stability focus coins are covered next including digits tether bitusd and maker dow these systems hope to offer the benefits of digital currency that is easy and low-cost transfer program ability etc with the stability of the US dollar then we dive into aetherium the first decentralized and open computer that promises to run unstoppable code also called smart contracts I give a demo of how to create and use smart contracts an amazing number of applications can be built on top of etherium like auger a prediction market prediction markets attempt to extract the wisdom of the crowd by making people bet on their predictions unlike political or sports commentators who lose nothing from poor predictions prediction markets put participants skin in the game also IOT or Internet of Things is very briefly covered with slaw kits smart contract control digital locks Dow's or decentralized autonomous organizations are also briefly mentioned and their potential to reshape how organizations operate the last parts cover some entirely different but interesting areas like storage including IP FS and decentralized identity and reputation systems I believe Bitcoin and decentralized technology have the potential to change how we interact online reducing the cost time and Trust required in myriad different applications I hope this course helps people better understand the projects working towards that",

            "transcript": "  the goal of this video is to explain the essence of how Bitcoin works without any jargon or scary math it is not however an introduction to what bitcoin is or why it matters for that check out the great intro video at bitcoin org with that said on to how it works Bitcoin lets people exchange money electronically as easily as sending an email or text to send money use what's called a wallet app to type in that amount enter a scanner recipients account number and hit Send the recipient will then see the money pop up in their account so how does this work at a basic level bitcoin is just a ledger with account numbers and balances when Bob sends Carol five bitcoins his balance goes down by five and Carols up by five there's no gold or government-issued money backing these numbers just people's belief that the numbers are worth something and a system that prevents unfair changes part of the system makes sure no one can spend money from someone else's account every time you hit Send your wallet app sends a message to the Bitcoin network describing how the ledger should change including the senders and recipients account numbers and amount to transfer so what's to prevent a thief from creating a message transferring money from someone else's account bitcoin requires a kind of signature on each message to prove that it was created by the true account owner the signature serves the same purpose as a handwritten signature on a paper check but it's based on math rather than handwriting the math comes from the world of cryptography which is normally used to hide secret messages but in Bitcoin has been repurposed to prove ownership each Bitcoin account number has an Associated key that only the true account owner knows and is used to create signatures by encrypting transaction messages others test the signature by trying to decrypt it if successful they know the signature was created by the true account owner in addition to not relying on handwriting analysis these math based signatures can't be copied and reused on other transactions since the signatures are unique to each transaction so these signatures keep unauthorized transactions from changing the ledger but who exactly is checking the signatures and overall maintaining the ledger surprisingly anyone who wants to one of the main goals of Bitcoin is to provide a decentralized system meaning no single company or government can control it every time someone sends money a transaction message is passed around to all the people who want to help maintain the ledger who all call maintain errs each maintainer keeps a personal copy of the ledger and updates it whenever they receive a new transaction with a valid signature with ledger spread all over the world traffic delays and occasionally fraud can lead to differences in those Ledger's so how does the world decide which version to use like in other democratic systems there's a vote but it's a bit different than a typical ballot system maintainer z' vote by trying to solve a special puzzle based on their version of the the first person to solve a puzzle announces their solution and everyone updates to that version so the vote turns out to be a kind of mathematical race but it's designed to favor the majority's version this is because the more people there are working on a particular version the faster it will be solved because new transactions are constantly being generated this voting process repeats over and over again so maintained errs can continually agree about new transactions so why math problems instead of say emailing in votes to decide on a ledger without a central authority to register voters it would be hard to enforce one vote per person a single person could create multiple accounts to vote more than once or even millions of times the math problems prevent this by making each vote have a cost in computers and electricity this means out voting or out solving the majority to take over the ledger would effectively require out spending the majority an unlikely event so the math enables a fair vote in a decentralized system to more important details about how it does this to prevent someone from pre solving a puzzle to win the race each puzzle builds on previous answers and the winner is not just the most recent solution but the ledger version with the most total solutions the puzzles are also extraordinarily special in that there are no tricks to solving them faster other than by buying more computers and electricity it's this property that underlies the entire system and gives people assurance that the solutions are truly from the majority and not a clever attacker a final note about how money is created every time a puzzle is solved a small award is added to the solvers balance effectively creating money out of thin air this award acts as an incentive for people to help maintain the ledger and is in addition to small fees centers attached to transactions because maintainer zhh acquire newly created money through computation they are typically called miners but their main purpose is really to manage the ledger not to create money the voting system simply provides a convenient way to randomly distribute money into the world and in fact after 21:40 no more money will be created in summary bitcoin is an electronic currency that's based on a collaboratively maintained ledger people transfer money by sending messages to maintain errs describing where and how much money should move maintainer x' make sure that the messages are from the true account owners by checking digital signatures and finally the maintainer is reached consensus with each other through a math based voting process I hope this gives you a quick sense for how Bitcoin works if you'd like to dive deeper into the rabbit hole check out my 22 minute video how Bitcoin works under the hood also feel free to subscribe for more concise tech

            "transcript": "  hello and welcome once again to coding in my sleep as usual I'm your host David Perry and this is one of my most requested and longest awaited videos ever welcome to everything you need to know about Bitcoin cold storage okay not everything that you need to know as it turns out Bitcoin cold storage is kind of a big complex topic there's a lot of information that you need to have to even understand most of the topics that we're going to talk about and that's the purpose of this video I struggled for a long time trying to fit all of it into a single video and it just didn't work so welcome to coding in my sleeps first ever multi-part series now in subsequent videos we are going to build and then use a cold storage system with this relatively inexpensive netbook that my brother-in-law purchased to hold his own Bitcoin stash now of the bitcoiners that i've spoken to this is the most common methodology but that doesn't mean that's where this series is going to stop there are lots and lots of very effective methods for cold storage and we're going to explore as many of them as I have time to film but before we can do any of that you have to know the basics and that's what this video is going to teach you I'm sorry to the veterans out there this one's going to be a little bit introductory but stick around anyway you might pick up a couple of things so the first concept that you have to understand to really grasp what's happening with cold storage is the concept of split key cryptography that sounds like really big complex words but I assure you it's not basically what it amounts to is that older systems used one secret to sign messages and secure information and if I were trying to communicate a message with you and I wanted to encrypt it or sign it we would both have to know the key that we were going to use ahead of time we're very accustomed to these kinds of Secrets for example every time you swipe your credit card you are sending your key your credit card number to a merchant services company who indirectly is sending it to your bank your bank already knows your credit card number so really all they're doing is looking to make sure everything matches if it does they know you're you and you're allowed to spend from your account of course this also reveals a fundamental flaw in the credit card processing system which is that you have to reveal your key in order to use it even if you didn't have to reveal it you're probably not storing it very securely and the fact that systems that are connected to the internet have to act on that secret every time you spend makes it inherently problematic the good news because it's centralized there's someone who has the ability to rollback transactions Bitcoin takes a different approach rather than making the transactions reversible which causes a huge number of both technical and economic problems we simply make the transactions harder to fake we use better secrets in better ways Bitcoin uses a methodology called public key message signing specifically ECDSA or the elliptic curve discrete signature algorithm now the YEC DSA works and in fact the way all public key cryptography systems work is that you start off with a secret just like you have with your credit-card number only much longer and you derive from that secret a second secret while different systems handle it in different ways what's important to take away is that the second key the public key is generated from the first the private key mathematically in a way that is impossible to reverse now what makes these systems work is the mathematical relationship between the keys again this varies from system to system but what's important is that we can use one key to mathematically prove we hold the other because of the relationship between the two you can do math on some arbitrary message using the private key in such a way that it can be verified using the public key this is important because there's no requirement in any of that mathematics that you actually reveal the private key it can sit safely on its own device doing its own thing perfectly secure and you can prove you hold it simply by signing messages with that device as long as the device remains secure the key remains secure this means that we've taken the big crazy complex problem of Bitcoin security and reduced it to the much simpler already mostly solved problem of securing a physical object now to understand why this air gap is important and how the whole system works you also need to understand a little bit about the way a Bitcoin transaction takes place while it only seems like one thing is actually taking place when you send bitcoins use your favorite wallet in fact at least three distinct things are occurring behind the scenes first we're generating a transaction then we're signing it and then we're broadcasting it now in this first step when we're generating the transaction it's very useful to be connected to the Internet the Internet can be used to fetch very useful pieces of data like the balances of your addresses or the exchange rate so that you can send the appropriate amount of coin in the third step we're actually broadcasting the transaction to the Bitcoin network so being connected to that network usually via the Internet is an absolute requirement but the second step signing the transaction only requires a device that knows the private key and can do relatively complex math there's lots of those laying around as a matter of fact there are a tremendous number of devices that can do exactly the kind of math that we're talking about and most of them could be used for some kind of cold storage system now the hardware requirements for this kind of digital signing are relatively low so it would be easy to create a small embedded device to handle Bitcoin signatures and I do expect that this is where things will go in the future however to my knowledge no one has yet implemented such a thing so we're stuck making videos about Acer netbooks still Bitcoin tends to appreciate in value fairly rapidly and unexpectedly so in the process of waiting for these cool new embedded systems to come about you may see your net worth double or triple and then be caught with your pants down it's happened to me over the course of the next couple of videos we're going to build and then learn how to use a cold storage solution based on the popular Bitcoin wallet software electrum from there we'll move on to paper wallets kiss-ass kiyose coins in any number of other ways to turn your virtual assets into physical assets that can be much more easily secured unfortunately that'll all have to wait for other videos because that's all the time I've got today thanks for
