            "transcript": "  if it weren't for vaccines half of you wouldn't be here today you'd be dead vaccines have prevented more deaths than all the rest of modern medicine put together people think the vaccines work simply here's your child give him a vaccine he becomes immune shown in blue he's protected from infection shown in red and so he doesn't get sick but that's only part of the story it also stops him from transmitting the infection to others the other white dots and that's critical I'm going to show you how this happens I'm also going to show you how you understanding this and you communicating it to others will decide where the vaccines in the future go on saving lives the way they've already saved half of yours so here's an example whooping cough when you get whooping cough weeks even months coughing comes in bouts that won't stop you can't get your breath you feel like you're cutting out your lungs if you're a young child you may end up with permanent lung damage brain damage or you may die this animation shows in each row of white dots a year's worth of newborn babies as they move across the screen they're getting older so that at the right hand side they're just going past 25 years old we're in the 1930s there's no whooping cough most of the dots are blue because people are immune to whooping cough they've had whooping cough there are gaps in the rows where previously children have died and disappeared off the screen every three years there's a big epidemic shown by the red wave going through the children on the left many of them died the survivors become immune shown in blue and the epidemic dies down then when enough young non-immune children have been born to sustain one another epidemic erupts and scythes through the children immunity delivering coffee strong and long-lasting there's no whooping cough in the teenagers or the adults here let's fast-forward to the 1950s whooping cough vaccine for infants have been introduced and it's been enthusiastically accepted by parents in fear for their children's lives immunity to whooping cough becomes near-universal by six months of age but now induced by vaccine not by infection the rates of cases and deaths of whooping cough plummets by hundred to two hundred times the disease is gone the problem appears to have been solved but it hasn't now we're in nineteen seventy eight everyone's forgotten about whooping cough it's not a threat anymore someone comes up with a theory later shown to be false that whooping cough vaccine has a rare severe side effect allegedly causing brain damage in a small number of infants this is widely publicized people lose their confidence in the vaccine large numbers more than half stop using it and children white dots non immune to whooping cough start to reappear in the population inevitably like clockwork the epidemics restart many lives are lost before enough vaccine is vaccination is reintroduced the confidence of the public returns and once again the disease becomes rare but the reluctance to use the vaccine remains strong in many countries so new vaccines are developed that have lower rates of the common side effects swollen arms high temperatures and so on these are introduced in the UK in 2004 but something else interesting and unexpected is happening slowly well perhaps not so slowly but we're quite slow to realise whooping cough starts to come back while we slow to twig because it's in the wrong place it's not where we expected in the young children it's in teenagers and young adults when a teenager gets a cough no one thinks of whooping cough because it's known as the disease of young children so why is this look at the blue color on the slide as you go across from left to right it gets paid the vaccines are inducing good immunity but it isn't lasting as long and the newer vaccines is fading even faster well whooping cough coughs in young teenagers and young adults bit of a nuisance you might think but nothing more you'd be entirely wrong who has babies young adults that's who or if you happen to live in the UK teenagers so when they get whooping cough they cough on their young babies and as you will now know when young children watch the red arrows are exposed to whooping cough they get very ill and some of them die and that's exactly what happened in 2012 in this country a dozen deaths and many scores of cases of whooping cough in infants after years of hardly any at all I think you can see from all this that when you give a vaccine to someone you need to think of it more broadly than just the person you're giving the vaccine to sure they stand to benefit but so does everybody else including people who can't make responses to vaccines and people who for whatever reason choose or can't get their children immunized what the UK did in response to this recent crisis was immediate they offered vaccine to pregnant mothers here the arrows are blue the babies are being born in Mew antibodies from the mother crossing the placenta or being swallowed in breast milk give these babies immunity but long enough to last until they are old enough to have been immune immunized and protected themselves around about 60% of mothers are already accepting the vaccine and happily at the moment even as Hoop incorporates in infants in the UK seem to be falling but there's a lot of point to all of this we don't just pass infections around between each other we're very good at communicating ideas as humans for a vaccine program to work people need to understand why it's important not just when the disease is common but also when it's become rare this is the biggest challenge for immunization in the 21st century what we now need to do to explain to one another how we can help ourselves and each other by using vaccines thank you",

            "transcript": " The information in this video is new. Not all health-care providers know about it. So feel free to share this video with your baby's health-care provider. We probably give 18 to 20 needles, sometimes more, in the first 18 months of life. Vaccinations are a routine part of a baby's medical care and keep babies healthy. But the pain of vaccinations can be distressing for babies and parents. And these negative experiences lead parents to delay or not vaccinate children. \"I think she remembers last time she was here.\" \"Is that possible?\" The statistics would suggest that about 10% of people avoid immunizations because of fear of needles. Many parents do not speak up about their baby's pain because they don't know what they can do about it. \"She was already worked up before it even started, because she remembered.\" In this video, we'll show you ways to reduce pain during your baby's vaccinations. They fit into 3 groups: What you can give: topical anesthetics and sugar water. What you can do: child-positioning and breastfeeding. And how you can act: your state of mind and distracting your baby. Combining the different methods together will lead to better results. Look at this baby's response to the needle. You'll notice there are minimal signs of pain. Observe the baby's body movements, facial actions and sounds. So, let's get started showing you how to use these methods so you can reduce pain in your baby during the next vaccination. Topical Anaesthetics. Hospitals all over the world use topical anaesthetics to reduce pain in babies. They dull the pain where the needle enters the baby's skin. In Canada, you can buy topical anesthetics at the drug store without a prescription. They're safe to use in all ages, including newborns. They're available as a cream, gel or patch. Most people have experience with them at the dentist's office. \"Here we go!\" \"It's where the needles are going to go...\" For babies under 12 months of age, the anaesthetic is usually applied to the upper leg, and for children aged a year or older, to their upper arm. You need to wait for topical anaesthetics to take effect. Maxilene takes 30 minutes to work, Ametop takes 45 minutes, and EMLA takes 60 minutes. If you expect to wait at the clinic, then you might want to apply them there, instead of at home. Just peel off the backing and stick the patch on the skin. If you are using the cream or gel, squeeze it out of the tube in a circular pattern on the dressing that's provided until it's about the size of a nickel. This is 1 gram of the anaesthetic, equivalent to one dose. And then put the dressing on your baby's skin. Make sure the edges are sealed so the anaesthetic doesn't leak out. Fold over one corner of the dressing onto itself so you have an edge to grab onto later to make it easier to take it off. If the dressing is not available, you can use plastic wrap. Just wrap it around the baby's leg or arm. Ask your doctor whether your baby is scheduled for one or more vaccinations so you know whether to apply the anaesthetic to one or both legs or arms. \"Now, I'm going to put the time on there...\" Make a note of the time you applied them, or write it directly on the dressing or patch with a pen so that you can make sure you remember to take them off at the appropriate time. Remove the dressing carefully, as it can get very sticky. If you pull it off too quickly, it may cause your baby discomfort, like when you pull off a bandage. Instead, pull the dressing out and away from the skin, slowly, while securing the opposite corner. The dressing stretches, and it will lift off the skin without causing discomfort. Then just wipe the skin with a tissue. You can use a washable marker to show where the anaesthetic was because sometimes you can't tell after you take it off. You might notice some changes to the colour of your baby's skin\u2014 either reddening or whitening. This is temporary and goes away after a few hours. Rarely, there can be a skin rash, which can be a sign of an allergic skin reaction. If that happens, ask your baby's health-care provider about using a different topical anaesthetic product the next time. Sugar Water. You can control your baby's physical pain during vaccinations with sugar water. There are many randomized control trials that have shown that sugar water seems to be an effective way of reducing pain. \"What do you think?\" Probably by a number of mechanisms. Whether it's just the taste that these little infants have in their mouth, which is distracting them, or whether there's some interference in the neurological pathways, it really seems to be effective. \"Okay.\" You can make your own sugar water. Just mix a packet of white sugar, which is about one teaspoon or 5 mLs, in two teaspoons, or 10 mLs, of water. You can use distilled water or boiled water. You can use tap water in older infants if you know that the water in your area is safe for drinking. Put a drop at a time in your baby's mouth, about a minute or two before the needle, using a dropper, syringe or medicine cup. You can also dip a soother in sugar water and give your baby the soother to suck on during the needle. \"Oh, good boy!\" Be careful not to squirt the sugar water directly in the middle of your baby's mouth. This can cause your baby to gag or spit up. Instead, put it on the side of the baby's mouth, inside the cheek. Hospitals use sugar water to reduce pain in babies, even newborn babies. It is safe and effective, but only use this as a pain medicine, not as a general comfort or as a food. Breastfeeding. Controlling your baby's physical pain with breastfeeding. You can breastfeed your baby during vaccinations instead of giving sugar water. Breastfeeding is one of the best ways to reduce pain in babies. Babies benefit from being comfortable in their mother's arms the sweet taste of milk, and sucking. It is a very effective physical comfort for babies during painful procedures. Start breastfeeding your baby about a minute or two before the needle. And make sure there's a good latch. Then, continue to breastfeed your baby during and after the needle. Your baby's legs or arms can be exposed so that the needle can be given easily. Breastfeeding during vaccinations is safe. There is no evidence at all that babies will gag or learn to associate their mothers with pain. If you cannot breastfeed, hold your baby and give sugar water with or without a soother. Baby's position. Your baby's body position during vaccination can affect how much pain your baby feels. Holding your baby upright can reduce your baby's pain during vaccinations. You can hold your baby in different ways: Facing you, chest to chest. Or hold your baby facing sideways. You can stand or sit or lean against the examination table. In all cases, providing a hugging hold and exposing your baby's limbs for the needle. If the needle is going into your baby's arm, make sure the arm is exposed, holding it firmly but gently so that your baby won't move it. baby's thigh, make sure the thigh is exposed, bracing it gently but firmly for the needle. Babies should always be held during injections. \"I'm right here.\" Before, during, and after the needle. Try to avoid leaving babies on their back, held down, or without parents, as this can make them afraid, which can increase their distress during vaccinations. And we've shown in studies that infants who are held by the mother\u2014that there's significantly less pain. So it makes sense that you should be holding, the mother should be holding, the caregiver should be holding, their infant at the time the vaccine is given. \"Hold their hand.\" \"Shhh, shhh.\" Discuss different positioning options with your baby's health-care provider and practise ahead of time. Try not to use too much force when holding your baby, as this can increase your baby's distress. Controlling pain during vaccination with your state of mind. Be there for your baby. Having a parent there makes a baby feel more secure. During vaccinations, be calm, use your normal voice, and be positive. This will make it better for your baby. Your baby looks to you for how to act and feel, so you can make it better or worse. If you are stressed, your baby will pick up on that, and that will make your baby more stressed too. One of the best ways to quickly become less stressed is to take a few deep belly breaths while holding your infant. Your baby will feel your rhythmic breathing, and this alone is very calming. Simply take a slow, deep breath through your nose, for 3 seconds, counting to yourself: \"1... 2... 3...\" And breathing so that it's your belly and not your chest that expands. And then exhale through your mouth for 3 seconds, counting: \"1... 2... 3...\" Take 3 breaths like this while cuddling your baby. The way the mother smiles, the way the mother holds the baby, the way the mother talks\u2014 what's the tone of the voice? Sometimes it's a language they use. \"Not yet, not yet.\" During distressing times like immunizations, the best thing to do, after you let them know that you are there for them by bringing them close, is to talk about anything but the needle, or the pain, and with a normal tone of voice. Even if your baby doesn't understand your words, they understand your tone. \"Oh my. I know. That was kind of annoying, wasn't it?\" \"Now you want to get down and play.\" \"You want to play with your brother and do bubbles.\" Distract your baby.

            "transcript": "  it's been 10 days of turmoil for the United States protests gripped the nation the pandemic continues and all this against the backdrop of Donald Trump's battle with Twitter for analysis I'm joined by Alan Dershowitz constitutional scholar Harvard Law School professor emeritus he was a member of the defense team in the impeachment trial of Trump best-selling author the latest book the case for liberalism in an age of extremism or why I left the left but can join the right Alan we'll start with the tragedy that's occurring in America now what's your reaction to all of this well there was no excuse for the police conduct in Minneapolis when a person is arrested for counterfeiting money or whatever the charges were our physical force of that kind is never justified if I were in a place where I could join peaceful protests against that I would do that but what I worry about is too many extremists both on the extreme extreme heartwright the neo-nazis the white supremacists try to hijack these kinds of legitimate demonstrations same thing with the hard hard left an tyfa and people who see this as an excuse to oppose capitalism America Israel they try to hijack legitimate protests so legitimate protests I justify and would join but the extremists on both sides doesn't serve the interests of justice but the president never knocks the right wing well he did when in in Charlottesville he did condemn the Nazis he did condemn goodell white head shots he condemned he said there were good people on both sides of wish he hadn't said that there are bad people on both sides I'm glad he said that is there are bad people on both sides look I wrote a column about that in which I said because he's a person of the right he should go out of his way to condemn the right more often I'm a person who was generally on the liberal side so I go out of my way to criticize the extremists on the left and I think point to me okay there there are reports that the president was asked to address the nation and he declined when we were going to pass that president's dealing with major problems we see a completely different leadership we see a man stirring the country Reagan with that famous speech after the astronauts were killed what's what's wrong here in Washington what's wrong well I think President should assert leadership I think candidates who are running for president must assert leadership we have a very important choice we have to make in the next half a year and we want to see who is the best person to lead the country during unpredictable times who could have predicted six months from now that we would have a pandemic that would have an economic shutdown probably we could have predicted we would have a police killing because tragically that happens every so often and there are legitimate reactions to that but we need a leader obviously who can lead during times of crisis and we're gonna have more crises and they'll be more unpredictable that's why we need to pick people who have the character and the ability to lead us during these terrible times well your new book is the case for liberalism and an age of extremism I'm going to ask you about that in a minute but one would think based on that that you would be voting against Trump in November well I never disclose who I'm voting for or who I'm voting against I can tell you I've never voted for a Republican candidate for president in my life my first vote was cast for John F Kennedy and then for Lyndon Johnson and then you Burt Humphrey down the line till Hillary Clinton last time around but I make it a policy of not disclosing who I'm gonna vote for until I've heard the debates in both sides but I'm a liberal Democrat what do you make of the current argument between Trump and Twitter is Twitter right that they can exercise their right as a private organization to edit it in my in my book the case for I argue in favor of Twitter and other social media having complete freedom under the First Amendment but they have to apply a single standard not by law but because they're so powerful social media is so powerful today they can't have one rule for the right one rule for the left one rule for Democrats one rule for Republicans they should have a single standard and apply it fairly once they do that the government really has no role to play in regulating social media any more than they have to regulate the New York Times Fox News Washington Post so the president doesn't have an argument here or they oh he does well if he tries to censor he has no argument he may have a political argument and he's entitled to make that political argument but and he's entitled to seek legislation which would limit the immunity of social media those are all perfectly proper within the realm of debate but if he ever tried to censor the social media or the ordinary media then all supporters of the First Amendment would stand in opposition to that shifting now to coronavirus there's no vaccine yet what are you or appeared recently and said it would be okay for the government to force us to be vaccinated yeah yes if the vaccine is safe and effective and necessary remember the government could never force you to take a vaccine to protect yourself if they developed a vaccine against heart disease or cancer you and I Larry would take that does would take that vaccine or because we wanted to but they could make us do it because it only protects us but if a vaccine is designed to protect us against typhoid mary walking down the street and infecting us the government has the right to compel that Supreme Court decision in 1905 Jacobson versus Massachusetts smallpox vaccination and the government was permitted to compel many states have done the same thing you can condition allowing kids to come to public school on having been vaccinated against contagious diseases but we have to make sure the vaccine is safe effective tested and that there are exemptions for people who have medical conditions that would make the uniquely vulnerable but there's no room for religious objection because if a policy is universal the Constitution doesn't require religious exemptions it only says you can't discriminate against religion which is why you can't order churches closed but you can order anything closed that has more than a certain number of people in attendance and that would include churches but then the Supreme Court rule that the government has the right to close churches no they have the right to close everything including churches but if they simply said we're going to close only churches or only synagogues or only mosques that would be discriminating against religion but if they have a neutral law that applies equally to other institutions now the churches have a good point they say why are Walmart's allowed to be open and in other places but not churches and the government responds and they did in the Supreme Court saying look shoppers just move by each other very quickly they can be socially distanced in churches and synagogues and mosques they sit next to each other it's harder so it's a debate and it was a five-to-four decision not surprisingly and the Chief Justice went with the with the Liberals yeah I don't know which is the liberal which is the conservative side here you know who they are yeah but this case is not a liberal conservative case I can imagine some liberals siding with churches in this one I think justice Douglas might very well outside you with the churches on this one and justice black but could ever want to deport those good could the government force us to wear masks yes in certain contexts yes they can or they can condition your being able to go in certain buildings look when you and I were growing up you could walk into any apartment house or any building and not have to walk through a metal detector today you have to walk through a metal detector if you want to go into certain buildings things change the Constitution adapts I want to discuss your new book sharam in which any a strong defense against you against the me to movement and the book is called lay the case for liberalism in an age of extremism why I left the left but can't join the right and you deal with your own problems with Jeffrey Epstein and this woman who came forward and accused you and you come up with a strong defense of that but now she's gone on camera to accuse you of God can you do that well sewer and I will of course and I probably will soon Netflix as well for having her lie what Netflix didn't show was she has a manuscript of a book in which she admits she never met me never met me she has emails in which she essentially admits she didn't even know who I was she never met me she there's a tape of her own lawyer saying she couldn't have been in the places she said she met me and she's wrong simply wrong Netflix had all of that and they promised me they would put it on as a condition for me being interviewed but they broke their promise so I'm considering suing them for breach of contract and for defamation she is just lying through her teeth this is a woman I never met and I can prove it categorically through her own written words and yet Netflix never put that on the air made it sound like it's just her word against mine it's not her word against mine it's her word admitting that she never met me and my word saying the why never man against her yeah you I do what people do what they did why did she go home very simple she's made millions of dollars already doing this she started by making one hundred and sixty thousand dollars for in part accusing Al Gore and Tipper Gore of being on Epstein's Island they were never on the island they never heard of him they didn't know who he was she then made millions of dollars in other lawsuits which her lawyers have shared it's all about the money she's suing me I think for 150 million dollars so if you want to know what her reason is for making up these false stories against me against senator George Mitchell against Congress bill Richardson against you name it she's named a Hood Barak the former Prime Minister of Israel she's accused us all for money of having she just has made up the entire story and Netflix knows that and they wouldn't put that on the air what we only have a short time left what is what does this bin like emotionally for alan dershowitz well you know makes me understand my life having defended people for years and years and years how it feels to be accused of something you never ever did I have had sex with one woman since the day I met Jeffrey Epstein my wife I don't frown I don't flirt I don't touch people's hair I don't hug I don't do any of that and then to be accused out of the blue purely for money by a woman who has a long history of lying and then the media believes it Netflix puts it on the air it's absolutely shocking but look I'm a tough guy and I fight back it's been hard on my family on my wife on my children my grandchildren but for me I have a thick skin I fight back it's hurts it's been very emotionally difficult it's caused physical pain to me but I'm gonna fight back and I'm gonna win in court we've been friends a long time and that friendship continues Alan thank you so much always a pleasure Larry",

            "description": "Why do some parents reject vaccines, despite evidence that they've helped generations of children stay healthy? When sociologist Jennifer Reich started interviewing parents about this growing trend, she realized it wasn't as simple as being ignorant or anti-science. In this fascinating talk, she explains why this movement is the symptom of a much bigger problem -- our broken beliefs about parenting & health. Jennifer Reich is Professor of Sociology at the University of Colorado Denver. Her research examines how individuals and families weigh information and strategize their interactions with the state and service providers, particularly as they relate to healthcare and welfare. Over the last decade, she has examined how parents come to reject vaccines for their children, in dialog with physicians, complementary healthcare providers, activists, and researchers.

            "transcript": " Transcriber: Eunice Tan Reviewer: Tanya Cushman So I gave birth to my second child about a year after 9/11, when our fear of terrorism was the highest we had ever known. It was the first year of the so-called \"war on terror,\" and we had a brand-new Department of Homeland Security. At one particularly panicked moment, we were all advised to go out and buy duct tape and plastic sheeting so we could seal our doors and windows in case of a bioterrorist attack. We were told to be prepared at all times, that the air could become poisonous and that infectious diseases could be weaponized against unsuspecting communities. The last stores of smallpox in a handful of labs around the world seemed an obvious choice. And so first responders, which included my husband, Dave, and my friends in my Health Policy Fellowship, were asked to be vaccinated against a disease that was eradicated in 1969. At the same time, as a mother of a newborn and a three-year-old, I was online, reading advice from other mothers: how to find childcare, how to make breastfeeding easier, how to get your baby to sleep. But among all the usual motherly advice, there was an unusual trend: mothers suggesting that you don't actually need vaccines against childhood illnesses and that, in fact, they might be dangerous. So here I was, on the one hand, watching as mothers said you don't really need vaccines against known diseases, like whooping cough and measles, and on the other hand, while healthcare providers I knew were debating getting vaccinated against a hypothetical risk. And while I was trying to make sense of all of this, Dave would come home from the children's hospital where he worked and tell me stories about children with vaccine-preventable diseases: babies on ventilators with whooping cough, a child paralyzed with tetanus. These contradictions seemed hard to understand. And so as a sociologist, I set out to study this the way I would any other project, to try to understand why parents were rejecting vaccines despite evidence that they've helped to keep generations of children healthy. I set out to interview parents, which turned out to be mostly mothers because women make most of the healthcare decisions for their families. We talked about their fear of vaccines and the harms they were afraid they could cause. They told me about their distrust of pharmaceutical companies and the government agencies that are supposed to monitor them. Some told me infection actually is normal and natural and that the body can heal itself so long as it's healthy. But throughout, mothers told me how hard they're working: making baby food from scratch, dyeing Halloween cookies with crushed semolina and beets to avoid artificial colorings, growing organic food in their backyards. These mothers were working hard to do what they thought was best for their own children, and that included avoiding vaccines. Now, it's easy to dismiss these mothers as ignorant, selfish, or delusional, to say that they just don't understand how serious vaccine-preventable diseases can be, or to label them as anti-science. And if you're like most Americans, you already have firsthand experience with these conversations on Facebook, at particularly contentious Thanksgiving dinners, (Laughter) hopefully not, but maybe on your children's playgrounds. And while I disagree with their claims and have fully immunized my own three children, what I've come to understand in the course of my research is that parents who reject some or all vaccines are actually responding in ways that are pretty logical to the pressures placed on parents today, and that this movement is actually a symptom of a much larger problem. So let me explain. Think about what we tell women from the moment they're pregnant - sometimes even before conception - and throughout their children's lives about what it means to be a good parent. From birth plans to food to school choice to college admissions, we mothers are told that our children's successes or failures rest on our hard work. We can see this culture of individualist parenting in the way we blame mothers for anything that goes wrong with their children. Your child's sick, your child gets bad grades, your child's poorly behaved? It's probably your fault. And when you fail to make perfect choices, someone will let you know because others are watching. When I was pregnant, I was stopped, not once, but twice, while ordering coffee by other women who wanted to make sure I was ordering decaf. And we know that for low-income mothers and mothers of color, the pressures are much, much worse, resulting not just in dumb questions but sometimes in reports to social service or law enforcement agencies. But we don't just scrutinize mothers. We also don't believe that there's enough resources for everyone's children to succeed: not enough room at the good school, not enough spots on the traveling soccer team, not enough jobs after college. And so we pit parents against each other, competing for what seems like a small pool of resources, trying to do what's best for their own children. In this light, the recent college admissions scandal starts to make sense. They paid a high price to try to ensure their kids could be successful in a world where there doesn't seem to be enough to go around. But our problem is not just individualist parenting; it's also what we tell each other about what it means to be healthy. Public health agencies, physicians, websites, blogs, magazines, apps, your watch, friends, even family will tell you that health is a personal project. It is your job to stay healthy. Count your calories, count your steps, eat less fat, eat less sugar, drink more water. I don't remember what we're supposed to do with carbs, but something with carbs. When we hear that someone we know is sick, we almost always wonder what they did or failed to do that led to that illness. And the truth is that most of illness is beyond individual control. Some of it's genetic, much of it's environmental, and some of it's just bad luck. But we don't act that way. We act like if you make all the right decisions, you can stay healthy. If we put these two trends together - one that says it's your personal choices as a parent that determine if your child is successful and one that says that determine health or illness - it's really not that surprising that an increasing number of parents see vaccines as a personal choice and one that's part of a broader strategy for their own families. But our personal choices affect others in significant ways. Vaccines work best when everyone uses them. Yes, there is almost always personal benefit for the person who gets it, but their real power lies in lowering risk of infection for everyone in the community. So take something like rubella, the most easily forgotten component of the measles, mumps, rubella - MMR vaccine. Rubella is a fairly mild disease for virtually everyone who gets it. But it was a leading cause of birth defects when pregnant women would become infected. And so we immunize young children against rubella not because they most personally benefit, but because they're most likely to be around pregnant women who most need protection. Our best public health interventions and social programs have come from the belief that we can do more together than we can alone. Free public education, sanitation, national parks, even fire stations are all examples of things we collectively fund and support but might not equally use and benefit from. And the same is true of vaccines, but we seem to have lost sight of that. Instead, pharmaceutical companies tell us that our daughter could be one less woman with cervical cancer if we use their vaccine, and public health agencies tell us we can show our love for our own children if we immunize them. Throughout, vaccines get referred to as a consumer product and not a public good. And so, like all consumer products then, it's up to you to decide if you need it, if you want it, or if you'll benefit from it. More generally, we tell young families today that they should support to the limits of their resources but that they don't need to worry about other people's children - just their own. None of this is making our communities better. This is what I was talking about when I said that vaccine refusal is a symptom of a much larger problem. Because this culture of individualism is a crisis, and it affects most of the social problems we face as a society. Because if your child has access to clean drinking water, do you really care if the kids in Flint, Michigan, don't? And if your child has access to lots of nutritious food, does it really matter if the kids in the next town live in a food desert? And if your child can get access to a charter school, if your neighborhood school is failing and can't pay its teachers a fair wage? We could solve all these problems if parents just stood up and said, \"Not my child, and not your child either.\" (Applause) We have to start dismantling this culture of individualist parenting. The first step is let's stop blaming each other for everything that goes wrong, particularly because so many things are beyond individual control. So when we meet a mother of a child with disabilities, let's not ask or even wonder what she did wrong during pregnancy. Just like when we meet somebody with cancer or heart disease, it doesn't really matter how healthy their lifestyle is or isn't. Let's just support them anyway. And let's find ways to help mothers who are struggling. Let's just give them a friendly smile sometimes or a word of encouragement, and yes, even when their children are screaming at the grocery store or on an airplane. Most importantly, let's find ways to show that we're invested in each other's children because - this is important - if we start acting like we're invested in other families, other families become invested in ours. Now, this won't solve the problem of declining vaccine rates overnight, but it will start to move us towards a culture of public investment in each other's health. And then we could build communities where everyone's children and parents can thrive. Thank you.",

            "transcript": " Improving the vaccination experience at school: An educational video for public health and school staff Hi, I'm Leslie. I'm a public health nurse, and I'm going to talk to you about how to make vaccinations at school a positive experience for everyone: students, public health nurses, school staff and parents. This information is evidence-based. All the techniques are scientifically proven and recommended in clinical practice guidelines. School-based vaccination clinics are a convenient and efficient way of reaching youth to protect their health. By doing our best to help kids have a positive experience, we not only show students that we care about them, but we also promote vaccinations. Kids are more likely to get vaccinated in the future if they have a positive experience early on in the school setting. Anything that can help kids and promote health is something schools want to be a part of. Research shows us there are very specific things that can help make vaccinations a more positive experience. Many of these strategies are intuitive for nurses and already part of their practice. We've combined these strategies in a program called the CARD system. This is an approach to vaccination that promotes student-centred care and coping. CARD was designed with input from students, Each letter of the word CARD stands for a different category of evidence-based interventions that reduce pain, fear or fainting during vaccination. C stands for comfort; A stands for ask questions; R stands for relax; and D stands for distract. We modified policies related to our school vaccination program to make sure we were incorporating the principles of CARD at two specific time points: first, in our vaccine planning activities and second, during the day of vaccination. Let's review these steps together. Plan for the vaccination clinics ahead of time and work with school staff to secure appropriate spaces for vaccination clinics. The library is a popular choice. It has several advantages over other spaces. First, it can be blocked off to traffic, which minimizes interruptions. Second, it has large tables that can be rearranged for the clinic. Third, it usually has a private office or is near to one. This is important for students who want privacy. Fourth, a separate waiting area for students can be created right outside the library. This way, students are not watching others being vaccinated before it is their turn. It's ideal if you can confirm these spaces are dedicated for vaccination with the administrative staff of the school ahead of time. Also, try to pick a time in the morning. This minimizes a buildup of student anxiety in anticipation of the clinic and nurses' anxiety from having to rush if it is scheduled for later in the day. Next, educate students and school staff about CARD using CARD educational videos and pamphlets. Make an appointment for public health nurses to show the videos in the classroom. For some public health units, this can be done at the same time nurses visit schools to distribute the consent forms. If nurses are not present in the school, then share the videos and pamphlets with schools, and ask the staff to share them with the students. The videos are online, so they can be accessed by anyone who wants to view them. Then, have students fill out the preferred coping strategy on the student CARD pamphlet. Review these requests to plan upcoming clinics. For example, private room, presence of a support person or use of an electronic device as a distraction agent. Be sure the options are clear. For example, a student can have one friend to be their support person rather than a few. Store all this information in a safe place for future reference. On the day of vaccination, work with school staff to ensure the clinic setup minimizes visual cues that promote fear and the spreading of fear to others, known as fear contagion. For example, use a separate waiting area for students, set up tables and chairs to prevent students watching one another, use a table divider to prevent students watching needles being prepared and to also provide a reminder of CARD and have a distraction kit available with items like bubbles. Bubbles are always a big hit. Visit students in the classroom before the start of the clinic to introduce the nurses, review the clinic procedures and remind students about CARD. This helps to prepare for the procedure and build a rapport with the students. Identify students who are highly fearful and vaccinate them first. Also identify students with special requests, such as a private room or the presence of a support person and triage them appropriately. CARD will not make all students comfortable with vaccinations at school. There are some students with very high levels of needle fear that are not suitable candidates for vaccinations at school. These students will probably self-identify as such. Refer them to experts that can treat their needle fear. Then, they can be vaccinated after that. Use a student-centered approach to vaccination delivery. Remember that pain and fear are individual experiences. No one feels pain and fear the same way. Help students to play their own CARDs. This means inquire about their level of fear, ask them what cards they want to play and support them in their choices. Provide choices if they do not select specific strategies. Coach them through the procedures. Afterwards, ask students how they felt. Make sure to chart this information for future reference so it can inform the next immunizer. So, a few things that they can do is, you know, giving them the opportunity to choose looking away or looking at the needle, having a friend with them, having a parent with them, having some other sort of distraction like their phone or a book or a game. Those are the kinds of things that will help them get through that moment. Let's see how it works. And so, some kids are nervous about\u2014are nervous about getting vaccines and others are not. On a scale of zero to three, zero being not scared at all or three being really nervous, how are you feeling? Great. What card are you gonna be playing today? Okay, and what did you bring for that? Oh, excellent. Are you gonna play a game or listen to some music? Okay, fantastic. So, I'm gonna get some things ready here. Relax your arm, and I can help you with that. Yeah, we want to make it, like, loose like spaghetti. All done. How was that? Fantastic. Get a band-aid... Let's see another example. Some kids get really nervous with vaccines and some kids aren't nervous at all. Let's say we had a scale of zero to three. Zero is gonna be the lowest. Where would you say you are on that scale? So, that's pretty high. So, you remember the CARD system that Kelly just went over with you as well. What kind of card are you gonna play today that's gonna help you with that? Nice. What kind of things you're gonna do to relax? Right, can you show me how you do that? Perfect. And what about distraction? Squishy? And I see you've brought a buddy with you, too. If the student brings a friend, ask the friend how they're going to help. So, you know what else can really help if your buddy blows bubbles. Do you like bubbles? Bubbles can be fun, so I'm gonna... have your buddy\u2014what's your buddy's name? Brooke. Hi Brooke. Do you think you can blow some bubbles while I get things ready here? Deep breath. Oh, you're doing extremely well. One more, honey, and then you're done. Good job. You're completely done. What do you think? You did really really well. And thanks, Brooke, for helping out. Using the card system can make a really big difference. Everyone is prepared, and the clinics are far less chaotic. Students experience less pain, fear and dizziness. I think it really worked. It really helped having this with me, and I had a little distraction. I used the distract card by bringing in my Squishy. I also brought in my phone so I could play some games, and I used comfort by asking if I could just get two needles in my\u2014in just the same arm. Um, well, being a buddy, like, it just really made me feel good because just knowing that, like, I'm helping someone that felt similar to how I felt, and just helping her, like, for the future and just, you know, giving her some confidence. My name is Tonni, and my daughter just had her grade 7 vaccines. Well, she has been very nervous about immunizations. She has been for many years, and, you know, I told her about\u2014 that there might be the CARD system, so we were just, you know, easing our way, working into trying something that we were hoping would be helpful to get her through the immunizations. So, when my daughter came home from school that day, I wasn't sure how the reaction would be, but when she came home, I could tell by the smile on her face, she was calm she was relaxed. I knew that it went well even before she even said anything. And when she did tell me how wonderful it did go, I was just so relieved and I was so proud of her and I could tell that she was proud of herself, as well. Asking students about fear is like addressing the elephant in the room, really, because we all have some level of fear or anxiety about something. It's just addressing the issue head-on instead of pretending like we're all coming from the same point because we clearly aren't. It's a great starting point to open the conversation. Kids know that we're empathetic and we know how afraid they are, and then that sets the stage for asking about the CARDs and coaching them. Using the CARD system just provides a framework to work within. So, as nurses, you already know what you're going to be doing with vaccinations, but it just puts it into a way\u2014 uh, organized way and runs the clinic very smoothly, that way. I really enjoyed my experience with the CARD system. I felt all the interactions with the students were fantastic. I love what I do, and this made it even better. The CARD system is not just about needles and needle pain. It's also about teaching kids ways to cope. They could use these same tools to cope with other stresses in their lives, whether it's a test, an assessment, something else going on at home. It can be used far beyond needle pain, but it certainly will help in the\u2014 in the vaccination process. Before the CARD system, we did have instances where students would experience significant anxiety. They weren't aware of their rights, their ability to self-advocate on behalf of themselves. The CARD system gives them that capability, and the hope is that with the implementation of the CARD system, that the kids will advocate for themselves and have a better experience through the vaccination process. With the schools, the teachers and the principals, the relationships we have with them are embellished because, through this process of working with CARD and providing informed consent, teaching with the students ahead of time, we are meeting their curriculum needs as well. The CARD protocol is simple, effective and research-based. The nurse in your school area is looking forward to helping your students make healthy decisions around their immunization and physical health. As educators, we too want students to make informed, wise decisions about their health. Here's a wonderful opportunity to work together with a common goal. Try CARD in your public health unit. You'll be amazed at what a difference it makes. Our nurses here say that once they learned about CARD, they can't go back.",

            "transcript": "  [Applause] [Music] scenes like this are popping up across the country I'm at Oregon State Capitol where hundreds are protesting a bill that would make vaccinations mandatory in schools technically that law already exists there are loopholes though and this bill would get rid of them but just as this protest is happening so is the largest nationwide measles outbreak in 25 years how does this happen decades of scientific evidence tells us vaccines work it's why measles was eliminated in the u.s. years ago so how do people wind up believing something that completely contradicts that the groups that I knew through Facebook for natural parenting were all anti vaccine like don't do this your kids could die there seem to be a lot of people that said my child has this problem now that they've been vaccinated this is Martina Clements she lives in the suburbs of Portland with her husband and two kids Ellie and Jack what was the process of figuring out what sources you were actually gonna rely on I chose more to rely on people that sounded legitimate because the CDC all of their information is it's very overwhelming is it information overload I think there's way too much and it's hard to sort through what is fact and what is opinion if you're on the side of okay I'm not gonna vaccinate my kids everything they're saying like you have to be skeptical of everything that the CDC says and nothing is accurate it's easier as a mom to trust a human and I guess then yeah and a website mm-hmm obviously Trust is important here but why wouldn't someone believe a source like the CDC I met up with David Roberts he's a writer who studies epistemology never heard of it neither did I what is a fiscal it comes from the greek root piste ma which just means knowledge it's the branch of philosophy that thinks about what can we be certain of what should we be skeptical of why is a Vista mala G a useful lens to try to understand what's happening right now what's happening in our country now is the loss of trust and authorities which means just who do you trust to tell you what's true he's right over the past few decades the public has lost confidence in a handful of institutions including medicine mainstream institutions lose trust you see these sort of trust entrepreneurs growing all over the internet telling their own stories for why they're the proper authority and why the mainstream Authority is lying to you right truth becomes a good babe you just are choosing do I believe the mainstream sources who I do I believe this alternate source these alternate sources aren't exactly hard to find take this Google search should i vaccinate my child there's a CDC but immediately after that two websites skeptical of vaccines once you get in this internet world we're just every Authority is on the same level it just all becomes arbitrary is actually reach people and when you try to debunk this stuff you just end up reinforcing it the only thing that could change their mind is a voice from within goes back to trust and leading them out but like who's gonna do this well some people are out there doing that one of them is dr. Jay rosenbloom he's actually the pediatrician for Martinez kids we go into the conversations with families like this making sure that they feel heard we're not saying that they're not educated that they don't have their child's best interest at heart because they do how do you as a doctor feel when you're seeing the growth of this the skepticism in this hesitancy I'm frustrated because kids didn't need to get sick my hope is that people will learn from their mistakes and they'll see what happens to people who get measles which is a horrible thing to say so why is measles a threat again well outbreaks typically start after someone travels to the US with a disease if a community has an immunization rate of 95 percent it shouldn't spread but vaccine coverage has fallen in certain areas making outbreaks more likely just look at Oregon it has the highest vaccine exemption rate in the country meaning families can skip out on shots for religious or personal beliefs these exemptions are often fueled by vaccine skepticism and they've increased in a handful of states over the years what we're seeing is a real-world consequence of the misinformation crisis in a world of so much information what is it that cuts through to people I'm telling them stories when I tell the story of the family that I took care of whose baby died of whooping cough it's a real reaction I I'm not I'll never forget the family I'll never forget the room that they were in and that baby didn't need to die it was preventable dr. Rosen blues approach worked so much so Martina did vaccinate her kids at no point did he say why is it this long that you've waited to vaccinate your kids he didn't judge you right when dr. J explained it to me the reason that we have vaccines is because there are people that will die and I started to be able to see it from the other side of no I don't want my kid to get some disease and expose some child that can't be vaccinated because of a weakened immune system Ellie and Jack are now caught up on their shots but that isn't the case for every kid good morning everyone my mother is an anti evacs advocate I want my entire life without numerous vaccines however in December 2018 I'm being an catching up on my missed immunizations despite my mother's disapproval that's Ethan Lyndon burger he's a high school senior from Ohio his story blew up after he went on reddit to ask how he could get vaccinated when did you start to think some of the stuff my mom is telling me might not be right I would see that people would disagree with her so I went through the CDC and found this article that said you know very clearly vaccines do not cause autism away into why you both came to your conclusions through similar methods you both went online what do you hope people take away from her story I've had people contact me that where moms that said because of my story know that they saw more appeal to evidence because I'm a human face I'm real person with a real situation and that's what it's really all about telling good stories think about it when's the last time you change someone's mind simply by fact-checking them or vice versa when it comes to changing someone's beliefs facts just aren't as convincing as feelings hey NBC News viewers thanks for checking out our YouTube channel subscribe by clicking on that button down here and click on any of the videos over here to watch the latest interviews show highlights and digital exclusives thanks for watching",

            "title": "Hearings on mandatory vaccines for N.B. students | Power &amp; Politics",
            "transcript": "  I haven't vaccinated my children I think vaccinations should be left to the individual to look at their individual circumstance and their health so mandating any policy I think is really risky both opponents and supporters of vaccinations have descended on Fredericton where three days of hearings are underway politicians there are studying legislative amendments that would make vaccinations mandatory for public school students unless they have a medical exemption religious and philosophical exemptions would no longer be allowed the bill was tabled last spring after two outbreaks of measles in the st. John area and whooping cough in the Frederickson area Dominic cardi is the Minister of Education in New Brunswick he joins us now from Fredericton hi Minister nice to see you again hey thanks very much for having me back on the show so what's your message to people like the lady we just heard who says the government shouldn't be the ones deciding whether or not they get their own kids vaccinated well the people still would have a choice about whether they wanted to get their children vaccinated but if they want to send their children to public school then there's a public health issue and it's very clear the science is clear that vaccines are effective vaccines prevent the transmission of potentially fatal diseases that up till a few decades ago killed thousands and thousands of Canadians and that's why as a government very proud to be part of it to be pushing this legislation forward because we have to think about the rights of immunocompromised kids kids who are going through chemotherapy you've had there seen their treatments take out the the effectiveness of vaccines they may have already had in their system those are the children who I'm concerned about not people who are falling prey to ultimately a well-funded delusion peddled by a handful of extremely wealthy people in the US and and other actors who are sowing seeds of mistrust where none should exist and that's why we need legislation like this today where a few years ago I wouldn't have thought it was necessary because now there is an organized group out there saying that vaccines are dangerous saying that vaccines cause all sorts of different conditions that they don't and we've got to stand up for science for evidence and that's why I'm very proud of this bill why give them a forum you know women like the clip we just have why give them a forum to express those views when they have been so clearly debunked by scientific evidence well that's a question you'd have to ask the the chair of the committee here because I wasn't responsible for who was invited but in the end I think very presence of those voices saying just as you just said sharing messages that are clearly debunked that shows the fact that now there is a risk to public health posed by these groups and by these individuals who are going out there and taking advantage of parents who have experienced trauma and loss with kids who have been sick become sick or in some cases have died and saying you know who's to blame vaccines and those groups behind this scam I think groups like vaccine choice Canada and others should be censured for the shameful way in which they've inflamed fears I without any justification at all so in the end while I found it difficult to stay in the same room with some of these people who make a living peddling books and conspiracies based on lies that are dangerous for our children and dangerous for our whole society what would seem them out there doing it is I think one of the best antidotes and makes people realize how dangerous these groups are and why we need to make sure we protect our children sorry to interrupt what would what would censorship censorship rather look like oh no censure as in just call them out I don't believe you I don't think we should restrict free speech I think we should win these people over based on arguments and there's a middle ground of people who are open to listening to both sides but there's a very small number who absolutely refuse and unfortunately in a system with a vaccine system where you need to have 95% if sort of the herd immunity that people talk about and you've got around 3% of vaccines that for whatever reason either the vaccine doesn't work it doesn't hold sometimes people don't get all of their shots so they're not fully vaccinated you're looking at a 2 percent margin of error in a New Brunswick we know that we've got about 1.5 percent of our school kids who have gotten exemptions and so we're down to about half a percent away from having herd immunity be lost and really exposing our whole population to two serious health risks especially our kids who are especially vulnerable to a lot of the diseases that we vaccinate against does your entire caucus support this legislative amendment I certainly expect so it's a it is a bill that was approved by Cabinet signed off on by the caucus and so I certainly that's the usual usual practice is the government support government bills but I always say to any journalist who asked me questions about things that happen in the people we'll see what happens but my hope is again that reason will win out here because the science is on the side of vaccines the evidence is there there are not two sides to this discussion there's the site of evidence in fact and the site of fantasy and delusion and we have got to speak out against groups that are preying on vulnerable parents and trying to spread electoral toxin in terms of misinformation that could actually kill significant numbers of Canadians it was only recently that we were losing thousands and thousands of citizens to easily preventable diseases in the fact that's receded in memory now by a few decades I think has made us complacent it's time for the moderate majority in Canada to stand up and say it's time that we protected our kids it's time that we only that we insisted on only evidence-based science-based decision-making around these sort of questions and I think if we can do that we'll have a healthier happier population better able to confront the challenges that the 21st century is throwing up against us I want to switch gears before I let you go and ask you about the decision to end New Brunswick's contract with the Confucius Institute for Mandarin cultural lessons in elementary and middle middle schools according to the article I read about this decision the Consul General warned you that it would impact your provinces trading relationship with China why did you still go ahead with the decision well I think that in the end there were negotiations that resulted in that in the middle schools in LAN primary schools no longer having the Confucius Institute that were negotiated with the Chinese so I think that was close to a win as I could have hoped for and I think the Chinese looking internationally I've got bigger fish to fry what does that mean well I think that when it comes to dealing with New Brunswick I think that's a very small part of their concerns and want to really reiterate again too that whenever I speak against the Confucius Institute that it's nothing against China or the Chinese people and a lot of admiration for folks especially of course the folks in Hong Kong fighting for their rights at the moment was there was there a warning issued to you that trade could be impacted that's what I had read in the paper I think it was it was certainly suggested and what was your response I said my job is to look after the education system for New Brunswick's children and you're not concerned at all about the potential impact on trade I mean I'm asking you know because there's a wider issue going on in this country where there is a lot of concern about potential blowback given the diplomatic dispute at a federal level there are other provinces or provincial leaders that have engaged on the trade relationship not brought up some of the domestic issues and I'm just wondering why you chose to pursue you know the path that you did despite the warnings well because there's I don't answer to any other any foreign government I answer to the people of New Brunswick and my mandate is education ministries to make sure that we had in New Brunswick education system where the New Brunswick government was comfortable with the with the education that we were providing for our citizens so that was a no-brainer for me okay I'll leave it there thank you so much Minister kardi pleasure as always actually on the show that's New Brunswick Education Minister Dominic cardi hi I'm Vashi Capello host of power in politics see more of our show by subscribing to the CBC news channel or click

            "transcript": "  there's another area which I feel like we're headed in the wrong direction I want to get serious for a minute if I could because I've been hearing a lot of talk lately and I don't know this is more prevalent in LA than other places but feel like it probably is but there's a small but still sizable group of people who are choosing not to vaccinate their children here in LA there are schools in which 20% of the students aren't vaccinated because parents here are more scared of gluten than they are of smallpox we now have measles event we've got I want to say something bad I didn't know if you're one of these anti vaccine people you probably aren't good to take medical advice from talk-show host and I don't expect you to I wouldn't either but I would expect you to take medical advice from almost every doctor in the world see the thing about doctors is they didn't learn about the human body from their friend's Facebook page they went to medical school where they studied all sorts of amazing things like how to magically prevent children from contracting horrible diseases by giving them a little shot you know those little shots of Botox which is botulism by the way you get your face to make your head look smooth and your eyes look crazy a little shot like that and polio is gone but some people do not buy into that because they did a google search and Jenny McCarthy popped up and she had clothes on so they listened to what she had to say and decided not to vaccinate their kids now and by the way let's say this would all be okay if your kids were the only ones affected they're your kids but they're not because unvaccinated kids put all children in danger especially babies who are too young to get the vaccination shot but of course that's according to doctors so you know take that with a grain of salt now some people are saying kids who aren't vaccinate shouldn't be allowed to go to school or daycare or go to public places but I don't here's how I think it should go if you are one of those people who knows more than doctors that's fine no vaccinations but you're not allowed to go to the doctor anymore why would you even want to go to a doctor who knows less than you do so if you fall and you cut your head open you will not be admitted to the emergency room stay at home find that sewing kit you stole from the Marriott and stitch it up yourself doc oh by the way you should also let your kids smoke well I wouldn't you the only people who say not to our doctors and they don't know so I feel like this is starting to snowball so we invited some real doctors to address this again these are these are not actors these are actual medical professionals every one of them is a real doctors who hear them out and then decide for yourself I am a doctor I'm a doctor I'm a doctor and I believe in vaccinations and I if you don't vaccinate your kids it can endanger their lives the potential downsides of vaccinations are almost non-existent the cumulative scientific and medical communities are in absolute full agreement that there is basically no reason not to vaccinate your kids no reason which is why I cannot believe we have to make this PSA I thought you settled this in the 50s hey remember that time you got polio no you don't because your parents got you vaccinated four years of undergrad four years of medical school and three years of pediatric residency I had to go to school for eight years I'm pretty sure I know what I'm talking about it but you people still won't listen now I have to use my only day off to talk to you you need to bug vaccines limit watching Breaking Bad I'm only halfway through the second season but instead I've got to come here because you listen to some moron who read a forwarded email perfect all these people had to set up cameras lights sound equipment so that I could tell you to do something we've been doing for a century look at all these people this is stupid get your kids vaccinated get your kids vaccinated get your kids vaccinated get your kids vaccinated or lose my number get your kids vaccinated or these doctors may never find out there Walt dies at the end of Breaking Bad you kidding me good pay for by professionals who know what the hell hi i'm jimmy kimmel thanks for watching if you'd like to see more click below to subscribe to our youtube channel and if not do nothing at all",

            "transcript": "  it's very important to be absolutely clear as to what is the national immunization schedule and if any new vaccines that introduced then you have to be abreast about them also now let us start our immunization schedule right from the birth begin wait at Birth we give BCG OPV zero hepatitis B zero dose then at six weeks ten weeks and fourteen weeks we give DPT one two three hepatitis B one two three and no PV one two three now as you must be aware in some of these states now we have launched with the pentavalent vaccine which includes DPT hepatitis B as well as Haemophilus influenzae B so here we will be giving only pentavalent one two and three along with opv one two and three last month the government of India has decided to introduce them injectable polio vaccine so one dose of the injectable polio vaccine is now given in some select five states along with opv three that is at 14 weeks of age after these three primary doses are over then the next primary doses of the measles at nine months of age which as you know is accompanied with the dose of vitamin A 1 lakh international units the government is also supplying the Japanese encephalitis vaccine at 9 months of age now this completes the primary immunization of the child after these are all booster doses next booster dose is at 16 months of age starting with the DPT booster one OPV booster one the second dose of Japanese encephalitis if it happens to be an endemic stay and we also give the second dose of measles vaccine at this time but in some of these states instead of the second dose of measles they've started giving the MMR mumps measles and rubella vaccine so that would be provided as an option and of course you have to give the second dose of vitamin to retie a minute then the next vaccination would be at five completed years and that would be in the form of the second booster of the DPT this is then followed by the two doses of tetanus toxoid at ten years and sixteen years of each and then once the lady becomes pregnant then we'll be giving the two doses of the TT vaccinations now these two doses of TT which we give the first dose has to be given as soon as possible in the pregnancy it can be given in the first trimester and the second dose would be given after minimum gap of four weeks you have to ensure that this vaccination is completed before 36 completed weeks of gestation also in the last three years if she has already taken two doses of TT maybe because of the prior pregnancy or because of surgery or falling a trauma then only a single dose of PT suffices what are the safe vaccines in pregnancy now remember that pregnancy is a state when the immunity levels goes down and in any condition where the immunity is low the live vaccines the live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated because in the body these organisms can turn pathogenic so any live vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy as well as in the immunocompromised individuals now a very nagging question very commonly asked is whether yellow fever vaccine is contraindicated in pregnancy or not because it is a live 17 D strain of vaccine remember that yellow fever is a mandatory vaccine if a person travels from a non endemic country to an endemic country so in the situation if a pregnant lady is traveling to an endemic country then she won't be allowed entry unless she's vaccinated with the yellow fever vaccine so in such situations remember that she can take a low fever vaccinations in unavoidable circumstances because in the past when a were accidentally the yellow fever vaccine has been given to pregnant women there has been no incidences of any teratogenic effects thank you for watching please like comment and subscribe",

            "transcript": " We haven't commented on the \"vaccination debate\" here at SciShow, mainly because there's nothing to comment on.  Vaccination does not cause autism and saves millions of lives every year.  But there is a debate as to whether vaccination makes sense.  And a lot of people laugh at that, but we at SciShow aren't about making judgments,  we are here for science and how to use it to better understand the world.  We understand the anti-vaccination movement as a phenomenon that needs to be understood.  So instead of saying again how, yes, vaccination is right and no, it doesn't cause autism,  Let's prefer to use science to understand why fewer and fewer people vaccinate their children.  I'm Hank Green and this is a SciShow.  First, let's talk about where this supposed connection between vaccinations came from  and autism.  The number of diagnosed cases of autism is certainly growing. Many scientists believe that this is above all  or entirely due to the existence of more effective diagnostic procedures and changes in  how cases of autism are reported.  So while the number of diagnosed approaches to autism is growing, it is certainly not possible to say  the number of cases as such is growing. If so, it must be due to some environmental factor.  When we talk about autism, we're actually talking about a whole set of developmental disorders,  which may affect an individual's ability to communicate and socialize, or cause the development of patterns  behaviors that are quite specific and rigid.  The disorder can manifest itself in various ways, but you have probably heard of them  as about \"autism spectrum disorder (ASD)\"  Although ASD has been found to be strongly genetically determined, it appears  that environmental factors are also at stake.  And that's the core of the controversy - we just don't know exactly  what causes autism.  And in the absence of a clear explanation, people tend to find the explanation themselves.  And the way our brains do it is almost entirely through cognitive bias.  Cognitive distortion is basically anything that distorts the way we process and interpret new information.  There are clouds of different types of distortion / slope - some distortions cause us to ignore certain ones  data; others force us to place too much emphasis on certain data; they can even force us  focus on facts that are in fact irrelevant to what we are observing.  But basically when we hear the hypothesis and think, \"Yeah, that makes sense!\"  so what we're actually saying is, \"Yeah, that corresponds to my cognitive distortion.\"  And so people justify autism with various things ... plastics, pesticides, use  antidepressants during pregnancy, GMOs, sugar, intestinal bacteria, and vaccinations. Basically  it starts with whatever makes the most sense to the person making the hypothesis.  The onset of autism typically manifests itself in one of two ways. Either parents notice a delay  in language development, typically around the first year. Or they notice the obvious  sudden loss of ongoing development, which can happen at any time until the third  People are pattern recognition devices. We need to be able to figure out what behavior  and strategies lead to positive results.  But even more than that, we try to find things that lead to negative results.  This overweighting of negative results is a well-known psychological effect called \"negative.\"  distortion\".  So imagine that you wake up one morning like this and your car doesn't work. Your brain will be  want to know what happened. Did you leave the lights on? You drove yesterday  a huge puddle and maybe something shorted? There must be SOME reason why he doesn't want to  start!  On the other hand, when you get into a 15-year-old car and it starts right after  what had the whole week to do to ride, you do not tend to ask \"What happened well !?\"  We spend a lot more cognitive resources on finding out why bad things happened than  on why good things happened.  In psychology, this search for an explanation is called \"attribution\" and  Different people have different ways of explaining styles.  Some people tend to blame themselves more, while others look for an external event,  which he blames. But one thing is clear: we are very bad at innocent of nothing.  Not surprisingly, parents of children with autism, especially those who notice  sudden losses of previous developments will look for a possible cause.  And if the most significant recent event concerning a child's health was vaccination,  which can be said about many moments in the life of a young American, we can call the vaccination  as a potential cause and consider it as a guide worthy of further investigation.  But that is perfectly logical. The problem is that over a dozen peer-review scientific articles  found no correlation between autism and the MMR vaccine or any other vaccine,  And yet, when you google vaccinations and autism, quite a number of search results claim that  there is a relationship between them and this relationship is kept secret either by the government  or large corporations.  Parents who are already struggling with frustration at the inability of doctors  to tell them why something like this happened to their child, they will find it live on the internet  a community of similarly frustrated people who share their values \u200b\u200band experiences.  These communities are full of stories that combine vaccination and autism.  And so, as expected, some people become convinced that they have found a reason  disorders of their child.  As soon as they decide, a confirmatory bias pops up. Confirmatory bias is simple  our tendency to receive easier, and with less control, information, and stories  worldviews that confirm our existing assumptions.  I repeat, it's completely natural and everyone does it. And indeed,  It has been shown that convincing someone that the presumption they believe is wrong is actually increasing  tend to believe the presumption.  And so a community is born and the safety of vaccination is questioned.  And as soon as the whole thing shifts from having the doctor tell you it's time to vaccinate your child  (and 99% of parents agree because the person studied medicine)  To question the need for vaccination, the vaccination rate of the population begins to decline.  A 2011 study showed that parents who are thinking about being vaccinated before their baby is born  they will have their child vaccinated 8 times less likely. In principle, this means  that when they have the opportunity to do their own research, what they find is confusing. And when you're confused,  so the standard choice is not to make any choice.  This is an example of another bias, which is called the omission bias.  In essence, we understand harmful activity as worse than harmful inactivity.  In fact, a frequently cited study found that when the choice of vaccination is conceived as an action,  The average parent will vaccinate their child only if the child is not vaccinated at least  TWO more dangerous than vaccinations.  This has to do with our perception of future regret. Parents say they will feel worse,  when they do something and harm their child than when they do nothing and  the child will be harmed by their inaction.  This perception of potential regret can be so strong that even just tossing over possibilities  action versus inaction seems counterproductive.  A 2013 study found that attempts to persuade parents to vaccinate their children did in fact  reduced the percentage of those who had their children vaccinated.  If vaccination is presented as a personal choice instead of a necessity for public health,  then potentially harmful inaction may seem more moral than potentially harmful  activity and vaccination rates of the population is declining. Parents choose to \"let nature pass.\"  And, as might be expected, this effect is stronger in people with a measurable tendency to  \"nature\". It is simply a tendency to perceive things that come from nature as natural  less threatening than things we invent ourselves.  One way psychologically measures this tendency is to ask subjects if they prefer a substance  extracted with plants or synthesized in a laboratory, even if they are chemically identical.  And naturally, other people have deaths against big governments or corporations and these  considerations about vaccination fit well with such worldviews. Here again, confirmatory bias plays a role.  But even people who are not so prone are more likely not to have their child vaccinated,  if they start looking for information before their baby is born.  This is due to another human brain error. We are really bad at what psychologists do  they say \"risk perception\".  When there is the slightest likelihood that vaccination causes developmental disorders,  Parents will compare the disease they know, autism, with diseases they never know  they did not see.  Measles have not been much talked about since the 1970s. Measles does not scare people  my age for the same reason we're not scared of by a giant man-eating squirrel ... never  we didn't see her.  Risk perception is basically a science in itself. But it turns out to be vague  The future risk, such as the future probability of the disease, is far less frightening than  current specific risk, such as the sudden onset of autism.  So, surprisingly, the success of vaccines is one of the reasons why people leave less  vaccinate your children.  So yes, it turns out that people are complicated, and this is a complicated problem. People  They are adept at understanding the effects of resource selection - like anti-vaccination online  forums - and often completely unable to accept the fact that a negative outcome may simply be  the result of something that is completely out of their control - and still not well understood.  This is not an \"anti-vaxxer\" problem, it is a human problem.  Those of us who believe in science or understand statistics and bias / bias, simply  they had a different life than people who give more importance to stories or opinions  friends or strangers they meet online and who have similar views.  So the next time you're frustrated with the drop in vaccination in America,  remember that we can only lead this debate because of the dramatic success of vaccination,  and that anti-vaccination activists are run by exactly the same people  logical traps and cognitive distortion like any of us. Only by understanding  and by accepting these psychological traps, into which we so easily fall,  we will be able to solve this problem. And that's what science is about.

His interventions aim, among other things, to respond to the anti-vaccination movement in a clear and scientifically accurate way and to educate the public, especially after the recent measles outbreak in Greece and other European countries. Antonis Darzentas studied Medicine at the University of Patras between 1989-1995. He specialised in Paediatric Medicine at the University Hospital of Patras between 1999 and 2003 and then completed his sub-specialty at the Children\u2019s Intensive Care Unit at Aglaia Kyriakou Hospital in Athens. In 2004 he joined the University Hospital of Patras as a consultant, initially at the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit and then at the Children\u2019s Intensive Care Unit of the same hospital until 2008, when he opened his own practice. This talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community. Learn more at https://www.ted.com/tedx",

            "transcript": " Translator: Chryssa R. Takahashi Reviewer: Ellen Maloney What is the most important medical development in modern history? Could it be open heart surgery? Organ transplants? Cancer treatments? According to the World Health Organization, it's none of the above. It's actually vaccines. Vaccines and clean water in developing countries are the most significant medical interventions in recent times. What is so fascinating about vaccines? Nothing, really, they are just shots. Those shots, however, have saved hundreds of millions of lives and continue to save three million lives each year. Let's take a brief journey through the history of vaccines. 500 years ago, smallpox and measles are introduced to Latin America by the Spanish conquerors, which kill more indigenous people than the armed conquistadores themselves. It seems that the Maya and Inca civilizations perished because of these two diseases. In Greece, just 100 - 150 years ago, the child mortality rate is around 50%. Half of all children die before they reach adulthood. Back then, the saying was: \"We have many children because God is due His share.\" In the 20th century alone, smallpox killed 300 - 500 million people worldwide. Measles claimed 150 million lives during the same time. These two diseases together killed five to seven times more people than both World Wars combined during the same century. We do not include whooping cough, diphtheria, polio, hepatitis or the flu because we lack accurate records. In 1980, the World Health Organization announced that the world is free from smallpox. Thanks to vaccinations, the smallpox virus was completely eradicated from the natural environment. Polio has had a similar progression. Last year, we only had 37 cases of paralytic polio around the globe. A disease that has killed millions and caused permanent paralysis to millions of others, is fast on its way to being eradicated. This year might be the last time that we encounter polio victims. We will preserve these two viruses in a testing tube, in the depths of a laboratory, as a record of two of the most lethal microorganisms to have swept the planet, killing more people than all wars combined. Same case with measles. In 1980, measles killed 2.6 million children and adults worldwide. Last year, for the first time, there were less than 100,000 fatalities. Then the anti-vaccination suddenly fad appeared. While we see people queueing for life-saving vaccines, in the West, people are moving away from vaccines. Last year, we had a 400% increase in cases of measles in Europe, with more than 40 people dead. In the U.S., in 2012, there were more than 50,000 cases of whooping cough with more than 20 people dying from the disease. A recent survey showed that 24 % of Greeks are hesitant about vaccines, believing they cause autism. Other countries in the West have similarly high numbers of people doubting vaccination. People in developing countries have little to no doubt toward vaccines because they've actually seen people die from diseases that we, in the West, have forgotten. These diseases are forgotten thanks to vaccines. Let's see how the anti-vaccination movement started. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield, a British surgeon, published a study citing only 12 cases - I repeat only 12 cases - claiming that M-M-R, the combined vaccine for Measles, Mumps and Rubella, causes autism. Wakefield further claimed that this doesn't happen if those vaccines are done separately. This resulted in a huge anti-vaccine movement in countries of the West, promoted by large media groups and Hollywood stars. Independent investigation later proved that Wakefield had been illegally funded by lawyers that specialised in lawsuits against pharmaceutical companies, had tampered with the findings of his independent collaborators, and not only that, and had also patented a single Measles vaccine for future financial profit. At the same time, dozens of independent studies were carried out on thousands of participants disproved any association between the triple vaccine for measles, mumps and rubella, or M-M-R, and autism. Andrew Wakefield was fired from the hospital in which he practised and was stripped of his medical license, he could no longer practice medicine. But the damage had been done. Vaccines had acquired a bad reputation. Let us now answer a few simple questions to shed light on the most common myths regarding vaccination. Is natural illness better? Is it better for a child to contract a disease? Absolutely not. Even mild illnesses can considerably lead to serious complications like meningitis, encephalitis, pneumonia, that may lead to death in children or even adults. Furthermore, a recent study proved that a patient that contracts measles is subjected to immunological shock, that erases the immune system's memory for previously contracted viruses. For the next several years, these patients were found to be at risk of dying from another serious infection. Second myth: Vaccines burden the body with useless antigens and pressure the immune system. To be clear, an antigen is part of the microbe that can cause an immune response. That is also completely wrong: vaccines contain very few antigens, the minimum necessary to cause an immune response. In contrast, when someone contracts the virus in nature, they are exposed to tens or hundreds of antigens, sometimes triggering an autoimmune reaction. Third myth: Vaccines cause autism and other long-term complications. The answer to the first point was evident from the earliest studies, but, further than that, 40 to 50 years of mass vaccination programs worldwide, thousands of independent studies and millions of vaccinated individuals no long-term consequence caused by vaccines has been proven. Fourth myth: Vaccines have immediate and serious side-effects. Vaccines actually have mild side-effects. Serious side effects from vaccines are very rare and can be effectively treated by trained medical staff. It's safer to get a vaccine than to walk on the street, or smell a flower on a field. On a personal note, I calculated that in 20 years of being a practising pediatrician, I've administered more than 80,000 vaccine shots. During that time, not once did I encounter serious side-effect. Not one. Fifth myth: Can we vaccinate children at an older age? We can, but it would be a huge mistake. If we do that, babies and toddlers, who contract diseases more easily and develop serious complications more frequently, would be exposed to unnecessary danger. Sixth myth: I didn't vaccinate my child and he's fine. When the majority of a population is vaccinated they form a contagion barrier, that also protects unvaccinated individuals. When vaccination percentage falls, however, epidemics return, because diseases have the ability to spread, naturally starting with unvaccinated individuals. In Greece, this typically occurs within Roma communities that do not vaccinate, with patients dying very often of whooping cough or measles. Seventh myth: Vaccines contain harmful substances, like mercury or aluminium. 20 years ago, a mercury compound was used as a preservative agent in some vaccines. The so-called thimerosal, you might have heard about it. This was removed from vaccines after the relevant recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics, even though it had never been proven to be harmful. A little-known fact is that when you include seafood in your diet, you consume 100 times the amount of thimerosal than getting vaccinated. Same goes for aluminium: a baby that exclusively breastfeeds, in the first six months alone, will have consumed ten times more aluminium than all vaccinations combined. If the baby that does not breastfeed and receives formula milk instead, will have consumed 40 times as much aluminium in the same period. Eighth myth: Anti-vaccine websites present serious scientific facts. Allow me to read you something. \"There is a substance that has flooded the human body. It contains formaldehyde, ketones, ethanol, tryptophan, urea, dihydrogen monoxide, large quantities of iron oxide, 20 further acids and 4,000 chemical substances. This substance can cause anaemia and leukemia; it also the route for cancer to spread. Pharmaceutical companies and governments spend billions of dollars to process and preserve it\". Did all this scare you? I scared you by telling you the truth, with no scientific inaccuracy. But the substance I just described to you, the one that scared you, is human blood. That's exactly what happens with anti-vaxer websites. Confusing, pseudo-scientific terminology, laced with a lot of scaremongering that a regular reader cannot possibly discern and is drawn to the wrong conclusion. Ninth: Pharmaceutical companies have an agenda for population decrease, which they implement through vaccination. When vaccination programs started 50 years ago worldwide, the world population was at three billion. Today it is seven billion and is dramatically increasing, despite a rise in deaths from environmental pollution and heart disease caused by modern lifestyle. We really don't need to say anything more on this matter. Tenth myth: Pharmaceutical companies greatly profit from vaccines. This is one of the most popular anti-vaxer arguments. Vaccines, in reality, constitute less than 3% of earnings for pharmaceutical companies. Less than 3%. Vaccines require high technology and are difficult to distribute. On the other hand, just one day of hospitalization, in a regular or an Intensive Care Unit, can cost thousands of euros. The same amount could be spent on hundreds of vaccines. Every single study has shown that vaccines are cost-effective and do not burden public spending, they actually alleviate it. And that's the reason countries around the globe, prosperous and poor alike, offer vaccines to their citizens for free. Eleventh myth: Anti-vaxers are pure ideologists that are concerned with our well-being. Internationally and locally, anti-vaxers promote 'healthy' and 'alternative' treatments. This alternative market is huge, with a turnover close to those of pharmaceuticals. Many anti-vaxers abroad have become billionaires. Also in Greece, thousands make a living by selling fake and dangerous 'treatments'. It was revealed that Andrew Wakefield himself has received 500,00 pounds worth of illegal funding from lawyers that specialize in suing Twelfth myth: Diseases were eradicated thanks to better living conditions, vaccines had nothing to do with that. Again, this is completely wrong. We have many statistics. All statistical data show a dramatic drop in diseases after their equivalent vaccine was made available to the population. Characteristically, vast India which managed to wipe out polio just a few years after introducing its vaccine, despite no changes in public hygiene. If anything, hygiene was worse because of overwhelming mass urbanization. Same result in the U.S. with the haemophilus vaccine in 1993, but also worldwide. Before the vaccine, there were 20,000 cases per year. After the vaccine, less than 1,000 in just a few years. Exactly the same happened with pneumococcal and meningococcal diseases, worldwide but also in Greece. A large decline in disease cases. Canada has excellent public health records, that reveal the number of disease cases before and after vaccines. All diseases saw a decrease of 93% to 100%, that is near eradication. Of course, that works both ways: in the 1970s and 2010s, there was a noticeable drop in vaccination rates for whooping cough in western countries. Sure enough, there was an equivalent rise in cases and deaths. Another tragic, example is the latest measles outbreak in Europe. What happened and measles came back? Could it be worse hygiene? Of course not. Vaccination rates dropped. Thirteenth myth: I hear your point but I don't want to vaccinate my child. Since you are all vaccinated, why do you care? On one hand, a parent that does not vaccinate their child exposes them to serious and mortal danger. That is illegal. On the other hand, an unvaccinated child can transmit a disease to someone who could not get the vaccine because they are not old enough or for medical reasons. Immunosuppressed children and adults due to leukemia or an autoimmune disease are the first to contract a disease by people with incomplete or no vaccination at all. In Romania, out of the 40 people that died due to the latest measles outbreak, 30 were babies younger than one-year-old, the age of measles vaccination. In Italy, a child that had beaten leukemia thanks to chemotherapy, later contracted measles from their unvaccinated sibling and died. Pregnant women and their newborns are under the same category, both groups very susceptible to serious or untreatable damage from these diseases. When we do not vaccinate, we do not only threaten our own child. We threaten all vulnerable population groups. Not vaccinating is anti-social behaviour. It's like running a red light or driving in the opposite lane of the highway. Consequently, vaccines are the safest, most important and most cost-effective public health practice. Vaccines are among the greatest discoveries of humankind. In conclusion. We are all shocked by the horrific images of death from the Syrian civil war. Do you know how many victims the Syrian civil war has had during those seven years? 450,00 people have died. Due to vaccine unavailability in developing countries, hepatitis B alone kills 750,00 people every year, 300,00 of which die from liver cancer, a consequence of hepatitis B. Hepatitis B alone kills almost twice the people as the seven-year war in Syria. For many years, I practiced at a neonatal and children's Intensive Care Unit. I saw children like yours and mine die in a matter of hours from pneumococcus, meningococcus, measles. I saw babies born deaf or mentally disabled because their mother contracted rubella during her pregnancy. During this 15-minute speech, 80 children around the world were saved thanks to vaccinations. Never again, thanks to vaccines. Thank you. (Applause)",

            "transcript": "  [Music] hello friends welcome back to another video tutorial from somos valor G and in this video lecture we are going to talk about vaccination types we are going to talk about different types of vaccines and their use their characteristics and also we'll be seeing what are the drawbacks of utilizing different types of vaccines including the live attenuated vaccines live vaccines subunit vaccines and all so let's begin to talk about it so the first things first is the overall classification of vaccines I believe all you know and familiar with the idea of vaccination and in simple terms if I say what is vaccine we can say that it's a suspension of microorganisms that includes antibody production to protect against disease and induces immunity so in a very basic terms what we can say is that vaccine is going to induce our immunity it's going to in like it's going to improve our immunity because these are nothing but microorganisms so those microorganisms that can cause infection in us that can result in diseases in us so what we are doing is we are ingesting those little dosage of those microorganisms in activated form of those microorganisms into our bloodstream so that our body's immune system is going to become familiar with them and it's going to be influenced by them to produce proper antibody against them and once our body produces antibodies which is a very specific fighting agent against those antigen or those pathogens then in future if that same kind of bacteria or microorganisms infect us then in our body those antibodies are already been prepared so our body is already ready to fight against them so we are not going to fill like feel sick about that same microorganism infection again in future so that's the overall story of vaccines and vaccination so but but how and what kind of microorganisms that we can choose for vaccination that's always a big question we now have almost five six different types of vaccination strategies not all of them are going to work the same way they are working in a different way there four different principle and not all of them working for the same disease for different disease and infection we have different types of vaccines working better than the other so let's talk about all these types we can divide these vaccines into two different type one is the complete agent we can take the whole microorganism as a vaccine I'm just calling it as an agent so whole agent as a vaccine or we can take just a subunit or fragment of that microorganism as a vaccine so with this idea we have a whole agent vaccine as well as a subunit vaccine let me take it called a whole agent and subunit now this whole agent back vaccine can be further divided into two different type either inactivated or attenuated now there's a difference between this term inactivated and attenuated inactivated means killed that means we just kill that microorganism totally okay we kill it on the other hand attenuated one is weakened that means we are not killing that microorganism but we are we are cutting some portions of its pathogenic activity we are reducing some portions of his now generally microorganisms are killed using four Moline solution we treat them with formalin and in prison no risk of getting the disease at all because we totally kill that with formalin treatment and and an example of vaccine that is killed is rabies vaccine we all take this Ravi's vaccine always so it's a killed vaccine so there's no risk of that pathogen to be present in our body again well attenuated vaccine is when we can use DNA mutations accumulated for a long term cell culture so what we do continue to change the DNA modify the DNA with chemical mutagens is going to change it and we check that for several rounds and several generations of cell culture but again there's a big question mark is always there because it's not totally killed that microorganism can reverse to a living pathogen and that can cause some infection in our body ability for attenuated type of vaccines Welling inactivated vaccine that's not a not a scene okay so attenuated vaccines example in our moms measles rubella vaccine in attenuated vaccine no booster shot is required okay booster shot means you know sometimes when we use very tiny amount of vaccinations like very small amount of microorganisms in small dose we need to take multiple doze in in interval in regular interval that's known as booster dose which we don't need for attenuated vaccine okay now what about the subunit vaccine subunit vaccine as per the name as we know it's only we take the part of that microorganism and the part of the microorganism we use adjuvant that increases the effectiveness of the vaccine adjuvant means large particles that can be tagged adjuvant means this is not a part of the pathogen we can take large detergent molecules or you know dead non-pathogenic bacteria this can be adjuvant because you know for generating immune response in our body our body needs to show a kind of very large molecule that's why the antigens that that needs to work they are bigger in size very small molecules are not going to trigger our immune response much so that's why we need to add this adjuvant full we can take other inert protein so we can take a portions of dead pathogen or we can take detergents as the adjuvant to induce the effectiveness of this of the subunit vaccine and the subunit vaccine is safer than attenuated vaccine no risk of getting the disease because you know an attenuated vaccine there is a fair chance of reversal of the disease which is not present in subunit vaccine but again subunit vaccines sometimes need repeated doses okay example of subunit vaccine is hepatitis B vaccine okay so these are the differences we can define the vaccines in different terms we can also classify vaccines in many other way but this is the easiest way that we can classify vaccines now based on this classification let me share few examples of vaccines with you and we continue with the live attenuated vaccines on lab example tuberculosis that is BCG vaccine oral polio vaccine OPV which is very common in India especially missiles rotavirus yellow fever vaccine all these vaccines are live attenuated vaccine inactivated vaccines which are killed antigen killed microorganisms that we use wholesale pertussis vaccine and inactivated polio virus IPV vaccine on the other hand subunit vaccine which is simply known as a purified antigen that means we take the whole organism we fragment eyes it we take only a few portions few subunits purify purify it and we use it as cellular pertussis vaccine hemophilia s-- influenza type B mo Phyllis influenza type B our HIV vaccine and pneumococcal vaccine there are example like PCV 7 PCV 10 and PCV 13 as well as hepatitis V vaccines can be used a hip v that's the part of the coat that can also be used as a purified antigen subunit vaccines so you can see for hepatitis we have both live attenuated vaccine I mean sorry yes as well as we have this this kind of subunit vaccine cell and toxoid vaccines toxoid vaccines are where the toxins that are generally secreted by microorganisms we dig those toxins and we exclude the toxicity part we call it inactivated toxins or toxoids and we do the same for toxoids that we do for inactivated vaccines that we treat that toxins with with formaldehyde and with high temperature and that's going to convert that toxins into toxoid and we use tetanus toxin diphtheria toxin and you convert that Eternals and diphtheria toxin to toxoid and we can use that for that particular disease tetanus and diphtheria so you know generally tetanus toxins and toxins are very common we generally take tetanus shot we need it's not going to induce our immunity for a life long time we just need to take that it's going to valid for only 2021 there's even one month two months duration only because it's only toxins not the whole body it's not even the subunits it's the toxins that is produced by by the microorganism and generally these toxins are produced from exotoxins exotoxins secreted by gram-positive as well as from negative bacteria so that's what we convert into toxoids and we can treat it we can use it okay now the final thing regarding all this stock scenes and also let me tell you the drawback of utilizing every single toxins with example for a summary you go with live attenuated vaccines we conversion of living microbes that can't cause disease but the chance the challenge is that there is a chance of mutation there's the chance of reversal the example measles mumps rubella polio which is known as having vaccine yellow fever all live attenuated vaccines second type inactivated or killed vaccines microbes killed with a chemicals heat or radiation challenges although inactivated vaccines are safest but weaker immune response and they need a boosters they need repeated interval of doses example of this kind is cholera vaccine flu hepatitis A Japanese encephalitis plague polio and rabies vaccines third type subunit type of vaccines includes antigens now that bests stimulate our immune system sometimes you also need to use adjuvant to induce so challenges are that identifying a specific antigen from a whole microorganism takes time and takes a research so development of these vaccines are expensive and time-consuming an example SEPA Titus V proptosis pneumonia caused by Staphylococcus Lamoni okay and toxoid toxoid again formerly inactivated toxins used as vaccines used when main cause of illness is a bacterial toxins so examples like tetanus or bottle ism generally caused by only toxins adverse effect it's not going to be caused by the bacterial presence itself if the bacteria releases toxin then only the disease happen that's why in those diseases only we use toxoids otherwise we cannot that's why the example diphtheria and tetanus conjugate a vaccine conjugate a specialised subunit vaccine where antigens are linked to polysaccharides as I said like you know antigens sometimes need to be linked with larger and polysaccharides these are most effective for immature immune system or for infants in this case the immune system is not well developed and if you provide the antigen directly their body is not going to generate an immune response based on that small antigen only so in this case they are going to leave this Diskin jiggets they need these polysaccharides along with the vaccines okay so that's why is this conjugates to use it examples influenza type B pneumonia caused by new-moon DNA vaccine we also use the DNA fragment as of X in DNA of important antigens introduced to cell but it's its role its proper use it's challenge it's still not known because it's in the experimental phase people try to use influenza and harpus as well as HIV vaccines production with the help of this DNA modification and generally they they are linked with the DNA mutagenesis to to induce this antigenic I mean immuno immuno genic feature in our body then final is recombinant a vector attenuated virus or bacterium used to introduce microbial DNA to cell it's just like you know rdt recombinant DNA technology based vaccines again we are again it's kind of limited to the DNA vaccine so that's why both are experimental level and both researchers are working for HIV rabies and influenza more because what we are trying to figure out here is that if we are using recombinant DNA plasmids that means you know if you find out the the gene products that can induce that immune response in our body and if we just insert that gene product in you know vector and transfer the vector inside inside the cell then the cell is going to have this response that's what we can do about this recombinant vector as well as this DNA vaccines drawback of different types of vaccines so that's that's kind of the end because we already talked about the drawbacks of the vaccine don't need to discuss about that either we already talked about it so that's regarding the different types of the vaccines how they're used why they are used and and all the examples that are very most famous for each of the vaccine types so if you like this video on vaccinations and types of vaccines please hit the like button share this

            "title": "Child Vaccinations - The Doctors Debate",
            "transcript": "  in 2008 already over a hundred and thirty cases of measles the biggest outbreak since 1996 and the CDC is blaming these pockets of children where there are communities where parents are choosing not to vaccinate their kids and this is a real concern for us right this is probably one of the biggest vaccine questions because the measles vaccines well actually the MMR which is part of the measles that's probably one of the biggest controversial vaccines maybe ten years ago this thing with autism came up but that's really seems to have settled down a lot you know most of the evidence linking measles with autism is kind of settled down and most of the doctors and scientists agree that it probably isn't the major cause but I still have a lot of parents coming into my office saying I want to get vaccines but I don't want to get that one and I say okay well let's talk about it let's what are the risks of the measles most people don't know one out of every thousand kids get to get measles will die it can be a fatal illness it is very very contagious now tell us what the measles are because most people have never seen it many times it's just it's a mild illness so you get this terrible rash and a fever and terrible cold symptoms and your child is miserable cough but in some kids it can be much much more severe than that and fatal that's a great point we do have a guest Barbara Lowe Fisher is here from the National Vaccine Information Center I want you to give us your opinion is this measles outbreak something that you look at and think well what we need to be careful here about the message we're sending to moms because if they don't vaccinate we could have a measles outbreak and it could become an epidemic where like years ago four million people are getting the measles well I mean I have to come from the perspective of a parent who has a vaccine injured child I mean in 1980 I took my bright healthy precocious little two and a half year old boy in for a fourth DPT shot and within hours of that shot I witnessed him suffer a convulsion a collapse shock a state of unconsciousness and he was eventually diagnosed with minimal brain damage including multiple learning abilities and attention deficit disorder with regard to measles a hundred and thirty one cases of measles out of 300 million people is not an epidemic we have a 98 percent that's a nation epidemic because kids are being batted we have more than tripled the numbers of doses of vaccines we're giving our children in the last quarter-century at the same time we have seen children become disabled and chronically ill one in six child in America is now learning disabled one in nine has asthma one in 100 to 150 develops autism one in 450 has diabetes that's the big question why are so many highly vaccinated children so sick and let's quickly explain how a vaccine works the vaccine basically it's an injection with maybe a killed virus in there or a killed bacteria so that killed or part of the bacteria basically fools the immune system into thinking the child just got the illness so that the immunes of memory immune systems of memory can then be ready for the next time the child gets exposed to the real illness and can fight it off and so that's why we as doctors love vaccinations because they prevent huge outbreaks of illnesses that can kill children but explain to us why you feel so passionately okay the first sentence I have to say is I'm not out to ban vaccines I don't I believe in the concept of eradicating infectious diseases sure right now the one size fits all for everybody not working a vaccination is a medical procedure that should have questions prior to getting a vaccination such as it's your child currently ill is your child currently taking antibiotics does your family have a history of autoimmune disease as your child allergic to eggs MMR cultured in an egg medium none of these questions are ever asked a 5-pound preemie gets the same vaccination as a 10-pound full-term er they need to be individualized and explain why you because way and why you decided not to vaccinate your youngest children I have three I've three children my oldest I it was kind of the sacrificial lamb he was vaccinated and had a huge amount of time aerosol huge amount of mercury and after he had the MMR and the chicken pox vaccination on the same day we never saw him again for three years never saw him again me he he developed autism I thought wasn't he lost language he lost social skills he lost bowel control he became very sick within hours of vaccinations so I you know I held his hand older over the proverbial fire he got burned don't ask me to line up my other two children to get burned again what kind of parent would be and that's really the discussion we want to focus on here is the requirement that you have to vaccinate your children my in certain states Jim correct me if I'm wrong but for the most part vaccinations are required right you know some of the other states will have religious exemptions not just personal exemptions but yeah your some states you're stuck you can't go to public schools you may have to us a lot of parents have to home-school and and that in itself creates a pocket what if I have a family history to a negative response to vaccination I'm literally supposed to vaccinate or educate like I have to choose education or vaccinations should I be mandated by the governor I will say no you shouldn't because I do have a few families in my practice that have some sort of familial tendency towards reactions to certain vaccines the live vaccines and they're all under in studies in a place like UCLA but that's that's not all families just just a few families that's why I'm against mandatory vaccines I think somebody should be have the right to say no here's the thing there's a lot of studies out there some of them show zero and let's just talk about autism for a bet first some of them show no link and some of them show a possible link me as a physician I stayed with an open mind when this the autism vaccine debate first came online and I I had a lot of parents scared and asking me questions and I kind of went along with it and but over the years over the last several years the data is shown okay it probably isn't just the vaccines what is it we still don't know I believe there's been other environmental triggers you could get these illnesses without getting back at it but what a great study if Offit and Gruber ding and a bunch of other people would go let's study the vaccinated versus the non vaccine no one is doing that study that study needs to be done i I do agree with you in terms of the one size does not fit all one size fits all doesn't work in medicine in general exactly so why are we doing that with vaccines everyone wants doctors to have all the answers but you can't have all the answers when there's an emerging new problem in this new illness that's on the rise something like autism where there's absolutely no evidence that it's from vaccines love to protect my child from infectious diseases I would love to walk into your own office and feel completely confident yes I'd like this shot to shot this shot and my child's gonna be fine the fact is I walked in he got shots and he didn't speak to me for three years dr. Altman I'm curious your thoughts because I have to tell you I tend to agree with dr. Sears that hey if you're a mom and you're educated and you don't want your kids to be vaccinated you should have that choice if you're making an informed decision in my opinion the problem is is that these diseases are still out there and when we have pockets of kids that aren't immunized or infants that are too young to be immunized or immuno compromised children that can't be immunized these diseases spread very quickly and we see a lot of children dying two things that I do want to point out because I do find that moms when they come to my office they don't understand this is that vaccines are always changing and being improved thanks to vaccine technology the vaccines we give today are very different from the vaccines that we gave thirty years ago and you explained how vaccines work there's those little immunological articles in them our immuno genic particles and all the vaccines together today have less of those than one vaccine did thirty years ago so that's something that parents don't understand me if I don't trust the pharmaceutical industry I'm sorry their bottom line is the dollar my bottom line is my child I don't trust the pharmacy Oh dr. Altman and dr. series bottom line is saving child's lives I will guarantee you all over yourselves to make vaccines safer and I will be the first one at your door to sign my kid up for inoculation I think vaccines have gotten safer like you said you know even the vaccine that harmed your child that's that's been improved Barbara like any other drug they carry your risk that's a greater for some than others informed consent has been the central ethical principle in the practice of modern medicine vaccines should be not separated out from the informed consent ethic and I think it's a human right to be able to decide what you are willing to risk your life for or your child's life for I think it's so important I sit down with parents if they're being vaccinated or not parents want to know they want to be informed and and I they want to know what are my risks for catching an illness what am i risk for having being harmed by a vaccine and between 1991 and oh one out of 1.9 billion doses of vaccines given there were 18,000 adverse you know bad bad outcomes one in fifty five hundred doses of vaccines will cause a problem that sounds pretty bad but no what are you the kids risks at catching one of these illnesses 85,000 kids a year will catch some sort of vaccine preventable illness out of 50 million kids that comes to about one in six hundred kids a year will catch some sort of vaccine preventable illness and that's each year so but doctor we still need to go back to this question this big question as we have suppressed so many infectious diseases in childhood we have seen this corresponding rise in chronic disease and disability and I think it's a fair question for parents to ask and scientists and doctors in the federal health agencies have got to answer this for us have we traded something let me say one last think the life expectancy in this country is longer than it's ever been and it's because of things like vaccinations now you have your fears and I understand that but the reason you do is because you have had a terrible tragedy in your life but there are a lot of people still alive today because of vaccinations and we we need to recognize that and whatever side you take we can all agree we are after the same goal we want to keep our kids healthy the bottom line is talk to your doctors make an informed decision the overwhelming majority of pediatricians in this country strongly support",

            "description": "Tara Haelle will focus on vaccine hesitancy and vaccine refusal. This is a global health threat that lurks unnoticed until it erupts into unpredictable disease outbreaks that are difficult to contain. She explains what underlies the fear and hesitancy that many people have toward vaccines, why it's not as irrational as some believe, and what's necessary to address it.\n\nTara Haelle is a freelance science and multimedia journalist who writes regularly at Forbes, NPR, Scientific American, Slate, Medscape, and other U.S.-based publications. She co-wrote \u201cThe Informed Parent: A Science-Based Guide to the First Four Years\u201d with science journalist Emily Willingham, and she blogs about science and parenting at Red Wine & Applesauce. She holds a master's in photojournalism from the University of Texas at Austin and has published her images in several publications.\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

            "title": "Why Parents Fear Vaccines | Tara Haelle | TEDxOslo",
            "transcript": "  it was just over a half-century ago that every summer gripped parents across the world especially the Western world with fear in its heyday of the 1940s and 1950s polio killed work paralyzed more than half a million people across the world outbreaks led to public closures people avoided friends and neighbors out of sheer terror that they would be struck by the disease or their children would the unpredictable an invisible threat of polio made familiar places like playgrounds and swimming pools suddenly terrifying so the arrival of the polio vaccine was like a liberation the enemy previously lurking behind every corner had been vanquished it was the tremendous relief that earlier generations felt when they no longer lost children to tetanus or diphtheria or yellow fever more vaccines have since followed against rubella hepatitis A and B pneumococcal and meningococcal disease and more even the Holy Grail a vaccine that prevents cancer by preventing the human papilloma virus vaccine we completely eradicated smallpox a horrifying disease that left those who didn't die scarred for life every one of you survived this most of you because you never had it because of this and yet we now find ourselves in a century when we can beat back more than two dozen diseases that once killed millions and the biggest threat to public health or one of them is not the diseases themselves but vaccine hesitancy the fear that holds parents back from vaccinating their children what happened how did we get to this point well when my first son was born I turned down a vaccine I didn't think it was necessary I didn't understand it I wasn't dumb or stupid I was actually in grad school but I was scared just like hundreds of other parents I've spoken to in the six years that I've been reporting on the ooh now to be clear I am talking about vaccine hesitancy and refusal but I am NOT talking about that very tiny percentage of people who spout conspiracy theories or show up a government meeting spreading misinformation about vaccines I'm talking about the fence sitters those parents are utterly terrified of doing the wrong thing of harming their child when all they want to do is protect them consider this quote in 1736 I lost one of my son's a fine boy of four years old by the smallpox I long regretted bitterly and still regret that I had not given it to him by inoculation this I mentioned for the sake of parents who omit that operation on the supposition that they should never forgive themselves if a child died under it my example showing that the regret may be the same either way and that therefore the safer should be chosen that quote comes from a kind of unexpected source a founding father of the United States an inventor and a writer Benjamin Franklin if such an intelligent worldly man as Benjamin Franklin all those years ago could fear vaccinating his own son vaccine hesitancy isn't new and those are the flicks are not ignorant or stupid in fact vaccine refusal rights frequently correlate with higher education so something else is at work here that something is what has kept us alive since we've been living in caves in hunting mammoths it's a cognitive framework that helps us make decisions it dictates what we pay attention to and how we assess the relative risks and bounty and benefits of different choices it affects how we translate our beliefs and values into actions and behaviors if we're going to address vaccine hesitancy we have to address the underlying processes that lead people to believe in fears lacking any scientific basis but first let me back up why is vaccine hesitancy such a problem why if I if my children or vachs why should I care if my neighbor's kids are vaccinated aside from humanitarian reasons well vaccines work in two ways in an individual body makes antibodies in response to the vaccine against the disease that standing army of antibodies then waits if the pathogen they're trained to fight arrives they attack it before an infection takes hold but the second mechanism is just as important widespread vaccination reduces the ability of a disease to circulate with fewer infected people walking around fewer infected people are passing the disease along no vaccine can prevent 100% of disease and 100% of people so this herd immunity is essential to preventing outbreaks and protecting vulnerable individuals but as people lose faith in vaccines herd immunity starts breaking down polio returned to Syria when civil unrest interrupted polio vaccinations there and in my home country just last year Mickey Mouse got measles an outbreak of measles at Disneyland in a country that eliminated measles 16 years ago spread to half a dozen states and to other countries that outbreak showed the power of a disease to return when vaccination rates drop Southern California has some vaccination rates lower than those of Sudan so that risk is clearly real of course vaccines are not risk-free either nothing in life is mountains of research however have shown us that the risk of a very serious vaccine reaction is extremely extremely rare most side effects like fever and soreness are mild and temporary and protection against life-threatening diseases meanwhile is usually lifelong and there's the rub vaccines have been so effective at reducing so much disease that we don't fear it anymore who fears smallpox any more no one who fears polio very very fear of what a disease excuse me fear of what a vaccine might otherwise do to a child has replaced fear of the disease the psychology term for this is availability bias part of that cognitive framework I mentioned you see our brains use heuristics mental shortcuts to help us make sense of the world with all of the sights and sounds and sensations and smells surrounding us at any given time we need to know what to pay attention to and what to dismiss we need a lightning-fast subconscious strategy for assessing our environment so we can make decisions heuristics gives us that one of these is availability bias the information that's most available or accessible to us stays at the forefront of our minds we hear about a shark attack we fear sharks the next time we go to the beach instead of riptides or drowning we also fear sharks because they're predators the same primal urge to protect ourselves and our children from predators can lead many parents to fear injecting their tiny baby's body with mysterious concoctions heartbreaking stories a vaccine injury true or not are more available to parents online and through the grapevine they haven't seen measles or polio in their communities so why fear them better not to take the risk of vaccines right that's what Ben Franklin thought and he was wrong that's omission bias fearfully avoiding an action with a tiny risk of harm in lieu of inaction with a greater risk of harm those parents don't realize unless they have Franklin's experience that not acting is a form of action - and if they do vaccinate and something does happen then it's all too easy to confuse correlation with causation the measles mumps rubella vaccine is given to children around the same time that autism becomes easier to diagnose if parents notice autistic symptoms not long after their children are vaccinated it feels natural to blame the vaccine despite all science evidence to the contrary our brains seek patterns and cause and effect makes the world make sense it's incredibly difficult to reprogram that especially when emotion is involved dozens of these thinking biases and errors lead parents astray parents think that something natural is better but dying from disease is natural to most nefarious of all is confirmation bias our brains are incredibly protective of what we believe and we seek out information to confirm that those beliefs we also engage in motivated reasoning to deflect threats to those beliefs at every turn and we're simultaneously really really lousy at assessing risk risk assessment requires engaging the intellect and these automatic cognitive biases are often much stronger that means that giving parents facts is not going to change their mind scientists learned long ago that our brains just aren't wired that way instead of a neatly arranged filing cabinet our brains are more like overgrown mangroves with fears and facts and feelings all knotted together a scientists are learning and ongoing research there will be no single strategy to fostering vaccine confidence a complex problem requires complex solutions sometimes harnessing those biases can work when the norm is to vaccinate and everyone around us is vaccinating people are more likely to follow suit sometimes also fear can work for better or for worse unflinchingly showing people what's at stake can persuade some parents and of course research into genuine vaccine risks which do exist needs to continue on going all the time people must be reassured that scientists are constantly looking for any kind of risks associated with vaccines assessing their safety and ensuring that their risks are outweighed by the benefits public health messages sometimes they can target specific fears of particular communities for those who fear unnatural ingredients and evaluates natural it may help to learn that the residual formaldehyde the tiny amounts left in some vaccines it's no different chemically than the formaldehyde that's in a pear and there's a lot more of it it's in our blood streams our bodies make formaldehyde but more than anything confronting vaccine hesitancy requires engagement instead of dismissing or mocking or fearing or laughing at mocking those who fear vaccines we need to listen to them genuinely listen a person who feels heard relaxes lets their guard down the cognitive biases are less engaged when the threat of being attacked goes away there will always be a tiny percentage of people that we can't reach there always has been that's okay we don't need to reach 100% of people just enough to keep herd immunity up when we come across someone who fears vaccines we won't get very far by laughing mocking accusing but we might get somewhere bit by bit with some thoughtful communication and some empathy and compassion thank you",

            "transcript": "  welcome back to Mayo Clinic radio I'm dr. Tom shives and I'm Traci McCray a measles outbreak centered around Portland Oregon and neighboring Vancouver Washington has sickened more than 50 people most of them children 47 of those infected were never vaccinated against measles there have also been measles outbreaks in New York and Texas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that children receive measles vaccinations in early childhood and while most children in the u.s. do get the recommended vaccinations to protect them against infectious diseases such as measles and mumps recent CDC data have found that a small but growing percentage of young very young children aren't getting their shots in fact the rates of unvaccinated toddlers appears to have quadrupled in the past 17 years for all of us and especially infectious disease specialists the skepticism regarding vaccines is of huge concern so joining us in studio to talk about vaccine for kids and to give us an update on the flu season as well is Mayo Clinic infectious disease specialist dr. new pune Rajapaksa welcome back to the program dr. Rajapaksa thanks to you again thanks it's great to be back good to have you here dr. Rajapaksa so it's pretty common knowledge now that the children in the Northeast and other parts of the United States who have gotten measles were not vaccinated yeah so with this current outbreak and what we see in most of these outbreaks that happen sporadically across the United States is that a vast majority of those who become ill are people who have not received the recommended measles mumps rubella vaccine occasionally there are some cases in people who received a single dose we know a single dose of MMR vaccine is about 93 percent effective two doses are upwards of 97% effective but by far the majority have not received the recommended routine vaccines for those mumps and rubella and the increasing resistance to vaccine is being guided a little bit a lot maybe by social media yeah so we see a lot of information on social media regarding vaccines obviously some Pro vaccine and some anti vaccine but a lot of people are now getting their health news there medical advice there scientific news through social media and so as a medical community we really have a responsibility to make sure that it's accurate information that people are getting the interesting thing about social media is kind of what you see is also reflective of the kind of engagement that you have with posts and so if you have already anti-vaccine kind of slant you will be presented with information that kind of confirms your views and so that's one of the big concerns and it's been quite interesting in the last few months to see some of these big social media groups kind of recognizing this as an issue and starting to take some steps in the right direction where's this misinformation coming from do we know so the misinformation comes from a variety of sources kind of dating back to the article by Andrew Wakefield in the late 90s which many people still kind of bring up as a reason that they are hesitant about vaccinating their children we know that since that article on MMR vaccine and autism came out we have had numerous numerous scientific studies that were well done that have shown absolutely no link between the two including a large one that was just released last week the largest study in a Danish population over 600,000 children that again confirmed what we we knew before which was that there was absolutely no link between MMR vaccine and autism but those types of pieces of information have a way of kind of working their way into the psyche and there are people who have profited from kind of spreading that information including celebrities and other people who have gained a following for their views and so that can be very difficult to kind of change what's your reaction to this read recently that despite the measles outbreaks and across the country at least 20 states have introduced bills this year that would broaden the reasons why parents can exempt kids from getting vaccines yeah so that is just staggering and very disappointing I think as an infectious disease specialist we know that these infections are preventable and that's really taking a step in the exact wrong direction there are states that allow philosophical and religion exemptions for vaccines and to try and expand those even beyond that really exposes our our kids to these life-threatening serious illnesses for really no reason at all and so it's very concerning to us thankfully many of these won't get passed but the fact that they're even out there are being proposed is really a huge concern I don't even know if I want to ask about the Russians is there anything to the fact that that's part of the misinformation piece so there have been some articles that have come out recently suggesting that some of the misinformation is being spread or amplified kind of by bots and all these things that can post things on social media so I think it's definitely a possibility and really it's not doing anything to to help get good information to parents who are trying to make these decisions are there some children for medical reasons that should not get vaccinated yes so there are some legitimate medical reasons why some kids should not receive vaccines these are primarily centered around the live so that's your measles mumps rubella vaccine and your varicella or chickenpox vaccine children who have weakened immune systems whether they've had an organ transplant are receiving chemotherapy things like that those children would not be eligible to receive those vaccines because they are kind of live weakened versions of those viruses let's talk about some measles myths one of them being that antibiotics will help you so don't get the shot but then just get antibiotics if you get if you do get measles so that's a complete myth there is no antibiotic or antiviral that works against measles the only care that we're able to offer for that is what we call supportive care or dealing with the symptoms that the child may have and we know that there are serious life-threatening complications that can develop from a measles infection about one in a thousand kids with measles will develop encephalitis or brain swelling that can leave them with lasting effects or death and one to two and a thousand can die from the infection itself and so very serious complications that are just completely unnecessary in this area era where we have something we can do to prevent these more myths more myths I guess are that measles is not that contagious it is in fact one of the most contagious infectious diseases the virus particles can remain suspended in the air for up to two hours after someone with measles has left and so you never even need to come face-to-face with someone with measles to contract it and if exposed ninety percent of people who are unvaccinated will develop infection and so that's why it is such a difficult infection to control once it has taken hold in a community that does not have immunity to it we promised our audience would ask you about the flu season it's peeked so we this has been an unusual year for flu so what we're seeing this year is an initial wave of h1n1 which seems to have peaked in the northern hemisphere what we're now seeing kind of on the tail of that peak in some areas especially in the south was a second wave of h3n2 typically we see one or the other in each season this year we're seeing some early indications that we might actually have both in one season which is unusual and so we're waiting to see kind of what happens in this area in the north in Minnesota but it's been a bit of a typical year so far in other areas of the country treatment if your child gets the flu anything special you should do so there are there's an antiviral available for treatment of flu called oseltamivir not everyone requires treatment we required we recommend treatment for people who are at high risk of developing complications that would be definitely children under two years of age children under five years of age may have a higher risk of complications as well pregnant women people with compromised immune systems or weakened immune systems the elderly or people who have underlying hard lung or neurologic diseases the otherwise kind of average healthy person with the flu will probably recover on their own and in that situation we recommend kind of symptomatic treatment so tylenol ibuprofen lots of fluids and tough it out so how long are you contagious when can you go back to work or school so people with the flu are usually contagious for about a day before they even themselves have symptoms and generally lasting for up to a week after onset of symptoms young children or people with weakened immune systems may actually be able to transmit for longer than that all right infectious disease specialist dr. new Pune Rajapaksa there is no question in your mind or ours that vaccines prevent serious diseases and deaths it is truly unfortunate that based on non-scientific information some parents are choosing not to have their children vaccinated measles for example as you've mentioned can be a serious disease can even be fatal thanks for joining us dr. Rajapaksa thanks for having me",

            "transcript": " -Aluminum, formaldehyde, dead viruses -- Why would we put any of those things in our children's bodies? This is a legitimate question that many parents ask about vaccines. So, what's actually in them, how are they made, and are the ingredients harmful? In the last episode, we learned how the smallpox vaccine was made over 200 years ago. It was super effective and ended up eradicating smallpox all over the globe. But the way it was produced, by taking pus from one person or animal and giving it to another, was really crude compared to the vaccines that came after it. I mean, ew. But the technology got way more advanced. Take diphtheria. It's a disease most people in developed nations have never seen because of successful vaccination programs. But through the 1800s, it terrified American families. Diane Wendt from the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History told me about it. -diphtheria's an infectious that's caused by a bacteria. It was called \"the scourge of childhood\" or even \"the grim scourge of childhood,\" and \"the strangling angel\" was another name for the disease. And part of what was really scary about the disease is that the bacteria that gathers and starts in the throat and everything produces a toxin. So, it's poisoning the body, but it also kind of kills off cells, and it produces this membrane, which they called a pseudomembrane, which can actually close off and, basically, asphyxiate a young child. diphtheria could be lethal, and there was no way to cure it, though doctors had some fairly gruesome ways to help children breathe. One was to perform a tracheotomy by making a hole in their throat. Another was to insert a breathing tube through the pseudomembrane. -You can see 1, 2, and then we get 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10 to 12. And that's actually the ages of the kids that it was intended for. -That's so heartbreaking. But things changed dramatically in the 1890s with a new type of treatment. -Unlike smallpox, which the treatment and the vaccine for smallpox kind of arose out of an empirical almost folk medicine, if you will, this was a treatment that really came out of what was scientific medicine in the new science of bacteriology. -The treatment was called \"antitoxin,\" and, essentially, it was a preparation of antibodies that neutralized the diphtheria toxin. It was made by injecting horses with the toxin, waiting for them to build an immune response, harvesting antibodies from their blood, and giving those antibodies to diphtheria patients. Now, I don't want to minimize the effect the bleeding had on the horses, but know that horses are less affected by diphtheria toxin than humans are, so they only developed a low-grade fever. -The new treatment came out of the bacteriology lab in Germany, and it was kind of announced to most of the world in 1894, and there was so much demand for it and so much excitement over it, that, in the United States, the public health departments immediately put things into force to try and start to make this new treatment. -Now, antitoxin was a treatment, but not a vaccine. It didn't confer long-term immunity because the patient's own body wasn't learning how to make antibodies, but, eventually, scientists figured out how to create an inactivated form of the toxin called a \"toxoid.\" Toxoids could evoke an immune response in a healthy person without making them sick, so if the person ever encountered diphtheria in the future, their immune system would know which antibodies to produce. This is how most vaccines today are made. We use toxoids or weak or dead version of germs to bring on an immune response. For example, diphtheria and tetanus vaccines still use toxoids. The measles vaccine uses a highly weakened form of the measles virus, and the polio vaccine uses a dead virus. Now, here's the thing. Toxoids are so harmless that your body sometimes doesn't bother mounting an immune response. This was initially the case with the diphtheria toxoid. It just didn't make the immune system angry enough. But back in the days of the antitoxin treatment, scientists found that when horses had a little inflammation at their injection sites, they actually produced more antitoxin. It was like the inflammation hailed more immune cells to come check out what's going on. -They found that if you could add some substances to these toxoids, you could kind of do the same thing. You'd get a better immune reaction from the body, and those are called \"adjuvants,\" and they're actually really critical to vaccines today. -The adjuvant used in that first diphtheria vaccine was the form of aluminum, which is still in certain vaccines today. It's not in the measles vaccine, but it is in DTaP, which is one for diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis. The amount of aluminum, however, is really small, and aluminum is in a lot of other products we consume, including antacids and some baby formulas. Additives are one of the most controversial topics surrounding vaccines today, so, while we're on the subject, let's talk about two other adjectives that people get nervous about, formaldehyde and thimerosal. Formaldehyde is used to deactivate certain germs and also toxins, turning them into toxoids. The vast majority of the formaldehyde is removed before the vaccine is administered, but a very small amount does make it into the final mixture -- less than the amount found in a single pear. Thimerosal is a mercury-based preservative that's sometimes used to keep bacteria from growing in the vaccine. It's actually in very few Some flu vaccines that do contain it have about 25 micrograms of mercury per dose. That's the same amount in a 3-ounce can of tuna. But on top of that, the type of mercury found in thimerosal is different than the type that can make fish dangerous to eat. It gets broken down by our bodies far more quickly. But if you're still concerned, you can get a version of the flu vaccine that doesn't contain thimerosal at all. There's a common misconception that thimerosal was at one point in the MMR or measles, mumps, and rubella vaccine. It actually never was. In 2001, however, due to public fear that thimerosal was somehow linked to autism, it was removed from all childhood vaccines, simply to reassure parents that vaccines were safe. There was no scientific evidence at the time that linked thimerosal and since it was removed from those vaccines, scientists have seen no decrease in autism rates. In the late 1800s, with advances in vaccine creation and microbiology, it seemed possible to fight any illness. Louis Pasteur famously claimed, \"within the power of man to eradicate infection from the Earth.\" But, of course, that didn't happen. We've made vaccines for many horrible illnesses, but there are still more we haven't been able to crack. However, new technology might be changing that. To learn about it, I went to the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health. -Classic vaccines have been incredibly successful, but we've made the ones that are on the easy side. The ones we don't have are the hard ones. -Take flu and HIV. They both evolve really quickly, changing the antigens that coat them. That's why we typically need to get a new flu shot every year. -The influenza virus, it's almost like it's dressed up. It's wearing party clothes, and each year, it sort of changes its outfit. -That's exactly right, and, so, scientifically, we say, \"Okay, how does the virus work?\" It has to get into the cell. What part of it does it use to get into the cell? It can't change that. But if we can be really smart, we can extract that part, show the immune system that part of the virus that usually is hidden, and we can make a response that's more acceptable across all different types, no matter how the virus changes its dress code. -New techniques are also making it possible to create a vaccine without even needing a weak or dead version of the germ. Take zika, for example. -So, that was a virus that we knew about, but was pretty rare and only had occurred in a few places, and all of a sudden, it took off and started to spread through large populations and cause disease. So, people went out in the field, and they isolated just samples from people who were affected, sequenced the virus, and, actually, that sequence was sent to us digitally. We never actually see the sample of the virus. -The scientists could then take the gene that codes for a particular zika protein and use that to make a vaccine. If you inject only that gene into human muscle, the muscle cells temporarily read the DNA just like their own genetic code. For a short time, they act like little factories producing the harmless zika protein. That allows the body to build up an immune response to zika without a person ever coming into contact with the virus itself. Another new technique to make vaccines that don't include germs is nanoparticle technology where scientists can create a small particle in the lab that looks like a particular virus. -That's particularly useful for dangerous viruses. If you think about ebola, We don't want to be dealing with growing a fatal virus in a laboratory or even using a classic approach like trying to kill that and injecting a killed ebola virus back into people, so we can use a virus-like particle or a nanoparticle that looks like ebola virus. -New technology like this could soon help us prevent more diseases than ever before, but when you make a new vaccine, how do you know it's safe, and is anyone checking to see if there could be any long-term effects? In the next episode, we'll learn how vaccines are tested for safety and why there's been so much controversy over vaccines and autism.",

            "transcript": " Hi! My name is Caroline. I\u2019m a registered nurse \u2014 just like the one you\u2019re about to see for your vaccination. I\u2019m going to tell you how vaccination protects you and why it\u2019s important, what vaccines you will receive and what to expect on vaccination day. Vaccination is a simple and clever way to protect you from serious diseases now and later in your life. It not only helps protect you, but it also protects the community around you by helping to stop the spread of diseases. All vaccines work in the same way. A vaccine is a dead or weakened version of a bacteria or a virus that tricks our bodies into building immunity against that bacteria or virus. Our immune system remembers this and is able to quickly fight the real disease if we come into contact with it in the future. Vaccination is the best way to protect you from many serious diseases. Some vaccines offer lifelong protection. In other cases \u2018booster\u2019 or extra doses are needed to continue to provide you with You may not have heard of some of the diseases before, because they are no longer very common. And this is because we keep vaccinating against them. Today you'll be receiving a meningococcal ACWY vaccine. Meningococcal disease is a rare but serious disease that can quickly become life-threatening, but you can be protected through vaccination. Meningococcal disease occurs when meningococcal bacteria passes from one person to another through close contact. The meningococcal bacteria are commonly found in the nose and throat of healthy people. Older teenagers and young adults are most likely to carry the bacteria and spread it to others through deep kissing. Although most people will recover, meningococcal disease can cause complications including permanent disabilities through loss of limbs, deafness, blindness, scarring, organ failure and sometimes even death. But there is a way to protect yourself. The meningococcal ACWY vaccine protects against four types of meningococcal disease. This vaccine is being provided to students in schools across Australia. A single injection of meningococcal ACWY vaccine is given to you in year 10 aged 14-16 years. \u201cSome of the tips my teacher gave me were wearing a short sleeved shirt.\u201d \u201cDrink plenty of water before and bring a water bottle.\u201d \u201cEating breakfast in the morning.\u201d \u201cAnd if you\u2019re nervous like me, make sure you talk to a teacher beforehand.\u201d When it\u2019s time to get your vaccination, you will be taken into an area to see a nurse. There may be other students in the room already with other nurses. The nurse will ask you some questions about you and your health including your name, date of birth and address. The nurse will check that your consent form has been signed by your parent or carer, ask if you are feeling well today, and if you have any allergies. The nurse may also have to ask some questions that may seem silly to you but it\u2019s important they know the true answers so they can make sure you\u2019re ok to have your vaccination today. \u201cBeforehand to relax I was listening to music to keep calm, because I was a little bit nervous.\u201d \u201cBefore my vaccination I was having a conversation with all my friends just to relax me, getting feedback from their experiences from their previous vaccinations.\u201d \u201cAfterwards I just moved my arm around a little bit and it felt fine after that.\u201d \u201cThe nurses helped me because I was pretty They gave me a stress ball to help me get through my nerves, and that really helped to calm me down.\u201d \u201cSo my number one tip going in for your vaccinations would probably be to relax, just breathe, don\u2019t look and you should be fine.\u201d The nurse will then give you the vaccine in your upper arm. Whilst getting your vaccine you may feel a little pinch, sting, tingle or even a mozzie bite sensation. It is important to remember that the more relaxed and distracted you are, the less you will feel. You'll then need to wait for 15 minutes after you've had the vaccine to make sure you\u2019re feeling well. Well done! You did it! \u201cNo, it wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought it was, it was actually pretty good.\u201d \u201cI think what helps the most is just when you breathe, you just breathe and you calm And the nurses are really nice too because they just talk to you about it and then they ask you questions that take your mind off it.\u201d \u201cIt didn\u2019t really hurt, it just felt like a little pinch, just a little sting, it didn\u2019t last for that long. And if you move your arm around afterwards, it feels alright.\u201d \u201cMine\u2019s just a little bit sore.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve just got to keep moving it, up and down.\u201d Remember, vaccination is safe, and it helps protect you, and the rest of the community, from serious diseases.

            "transcript": "  this is Sarah the registered nurse RN calm and in this video I'm going to be going over at the vaccination schedule for children zero to six years and I'm going to be giving you some mnemonics on how you can remember all these vaccines and as always at the end of this YouTube video you can access the free quiz that will test you on this material so let's get started we will start with birth and this is super easy all that's required at birth is the hepatitis B vaccine and there will be three doses given in the first dose will be I birth next is it two months and they will get several vaccines at this visit they will get the hepatitis B which will be your second dose our DTaP which is for diphtheria tetanus and pertussis the hip vaccine which is for Hamas Phyllis influenza type B which will help prevent against epiglottitis polio the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine which is the PCV and then the RV vaccine which is the rotavirus vaccine then at four months they will get everything they got at two months except the hepatitis B vaccine so they will get the D type they will get the hip polio PCV and RV then it's six months it's really easy because it's exactly what they got at two months which will include hepatitis B the D type the hip polio PCV and the RV and then also at six months they will start receiving an annual flu vaccine so if you can remember from 2 to 6 months they get exactly the same vaccines and it's six of them but then at four months they will get everything except hepatitis B then we move on to 12 to 18 months so here the child will get the D top and they'll get this at the 15 to 18 month mark and then hip PCV the MMR which is new we're adding on and the varicella which is chicken pox and then they'll also get the hepatitis A vaccine which is going to be required in two doses they'll get one dose at 12 months which is one year and then they'll get the second dose six months later at eighteen months and of course the annual flu shot during flu season and finally between four to six years old they will get the falling vaccines and there's only four of them so I think that's easy because I remember that it starts at four years so they'll get the DTaP polio MMR and the varicella and of course if it's flu season they'll get the annual flu shot now let's go over some new monix to help you remember when these vaccines should be given okay at birth that is easy they just need one vaccine and it's the hepatitis B vaccine so birth hepatitis B you can remember that one just one now let's remember the vaccines from two to six months because if we can remember all these vaccines we just have to remember those and we've knocked out a lot of them so whenever I created these mnemonics I wanted them to be able to help you to identify what age they need to be given what exactly is given so as I pointed out earlier at two months and six months it's the same exact vaccines that are being given there's six of them but it's changed it for months all of those are being given except hepatitis B so this mnemonic is going to help you remember that it says two six month old pediatric policies discuss rejecting his Hep B at four months so this tells us that at two and six months the child will need the following pediatric represents pneumococcal conjugate virus the PCV policies represents polio disgust represents DTaP rejecting represents rotavirus his represents him and Hep B represents of course hepatitis B and it ends at four months so it's telling us that the child will need all those vaccines except hence rejecting the Hep B at four months now let's look at some mnemonics for the next to a categories okay we're doing 12 to 18 months and remember with this one we're going to be giving D top hip PCB but we're adding on MMR and varicella and Hep A and remember Hep A is going to be given in two doses one at 12 months and then one six months later at 18 months so here's a mnemonic to help you remember all those in that category his 12 to 18 dispatch montt vaccines helped people his represents him told the 18 represents the category we're talking about of Ages so 12 to 18 dispatch represents DTaP mump represents MMR vaccines represents the varicella helped represents Hep A remember there's two doses of that one given at this age group and then people represents PCV and lastly to help us remember four to six years remember there's just four of them you can remember this mnemonic police dispatch four to six year old month vaccines so police represents polio this Factory represents DTaP 46 year old is the age category month is the measles mumps rubella vaccine and then vaccine represents varicella okay so those are the recommended vaccines for children ages 0 to 6 thank you so much for watching don't forget to take the free quiz and to subscribe to our channel for more videos",

            "transcript": " If you\u2019re wondering, what has immunology ever done for me? Well the answer\u2019s quite simple -vaccination; a really easy procedure that protects all of us from infectious disease. Vaccination is providing protection by utilizing either pre-existing components of the immune response or more commonly, by inducing the generation of antigen-specific memory cells. We can divide immunization into active or passive immunization. The most common form is active immunization where there is injection of antigen. This often requires additional components, for example an adjuvant. The immune response is generated in vivo. It takes time to develop but it provides long term protection because there is generation of memory T-cells and memory B-cells in response to the vaccination. There is the potential to develop both a cell-mediated and a humoral response. In contrast, passive immunization is the injection of pre-formed antibodies. This provides immediate protection, but the protection is short term. Antibody has a half life of about three weeks in the circulation. So the protection provided by these injected antibodies doesn\u2019t last for a very long time. It only provides humoral immunity. The pathogen needs to be susceptible to antibody mediated destruction. If cytotoxic T-cells are required, then passive immunization will not be helpful. And there is the risk of adventitious pathogen transfer. Let\u2019s have a look at some examples of passive immunization. Horse antisera against snake venom, botulism toxin and diphtheria toxin can be administered to individuals exposed to these toxic agents. Pooled human immunoglobulin against Hepatitis A or B, measles, rabies, tetanus, varicella zoster, and humanized monoclonal antibody against respiratory syncytial virus can all be given to patients that are exposed to these agents. With regard to active immunization, vaccines can induce neutralizing antibodies. Viruses need to bind to cell surface receptors on cells in order to infect cells. Antibodies can block the binding of viruses to their cell surface receptors. Bacteria can produce toxins, these can poison our cells. Antibodies can block the toxic activity of bacterial toxins. Finally, in order to establish an infection, many microorganisms need to colonize surfaces in the body. Antibodies, particularly dimeric secretory IgA can prevent colonization. Let\u2019s have a look at the immunological basis of active vaccination. Here we have a diagram showing you the magnitude of the immune response following the first encounter with antigens from a pathogen. This will be a natural infection that we would be exposed to. The primary immune response is fairly weak and short lived. However, if instead of encountering the natural infection, that is potentially pathogenic, we give a modified version of the pathogen; in other words the antigens are seen in a non-pathogenic form. Then we elicit this primary immune response. And importantly, memory T-cells and B-cells are generated. Looking at the secondary immune response, if the subsequent encounter is with the actual pathogen itself, the individual goes straight into making a secondary immune response because the primary immune response was elicited by the non-pathogenic form. And now there is a secondary immune response which is strong and long lasting. And this occurs in response to the actual pathogen upon the first encounter. So because memory cells are already present as a result of the vaccination, a secondary immune response occurs on the first encounter with the pathogen. This is here really just for your information. I\u2019m not going to read through this. You can read through it at your leisure. But it provides you with the current vaccination schedule for the USA.",

            "description": "\"Vaccines are BAD! Wait! Vaccines are GOOD!\" - Pediatric Nurse Practitioner, Danielle Stringer, shares her experience and ideas that caused her to leave her vaccine-hesitancy behind and advocate for immunizations.\n\nDanielle Stringer was born and raised in Arizona. Dani knew she wanted to be a nurse from the age of 10 and went on to do just that. Stringer graduated Summa Cum Laude from Arizona State University with both her Bachelor of Science in Nursing and Master of Science in Nursing. She graduated at age 18, and became the youngest pediatric nurse practitioner in the country! In 2014, she started a blog, www.kidnurse.org, to raise awareness for pediatric health issues which currently has over 2 million views.\r\n\n\nThis talk was given at a TEDx event using the TED conference format but independently organized by a local community.

            "transcript": "  it was midnight when my phone rang I was still awake reading the comments people were leaving on my latest blog post in what seemed like an unending stream it was CNN on the phone letting me know that Anderson Cooper wanted to cover my latest story that I published just hours before by morning most the major news stations had called this was 2015 there had just been a major measles outbreak at Disneyland resulting in 125 people contracting this dangerous disease a pediatrician in my community wrote a letter explaining that his family had been exposed to the measles by an unvaccinated child his three-year-old daughter had leukemia and his 10 month old son was too young to be vaccinated against the measles if his immune compromised daughter contracted the measles there could be devastating life-threatening consequences I was so touched by his story and plea for parents to vaccinate their children that I published his letter on my pediatric health side kid nurse so that it could be shared beyond our community within 24 hours my site had crashed three times due to the hundreds of thousands of readers from over 200 countries across the globe my name is Danny stringer I'm also known as the kid nurse this was a nickname born back in my college days due to its double meaning at the time I was a nurse learning to take care of kids by specializing in Pediatrics but really I was a kid myself I became a registered nurse at the age of 17 then I earned my master's degree and became a pediatric nurse practitioner by 18 this made me the youngest nurse practitioner in the world so truly that's how my story is the kid nurse began I've had the honour of caring for thousands of children over the past six years during my time in practice I've discovered that parents desperately need access to quality pediatric information online I decided to solve this by bringing the education I was giving every day in my exam room to the online world and that's how the kid nurse blog was born I started by tackling a topic that was very personal to me the title of my first post was my journey leaving the anti-vaccination movement i admitted to the world that day that before becoming a pediatric nurse practitioner i considered myself to be highly skeptical of vaccinations growing up I'd heard all the most notorious accusations against vaccines autism mercury government agendas big pharma you name it I'll never forget the conversation I had with my mom when I told her my desired career choice that's wonderful she said but you do realize you'll have to give vaccines right the drawback of administering vaccines nearly made me choose a different specialty and reasonably so as I didn't want to be responsible for giving something to children I didn't believe in conflicted as I was at the time I decided to move forward with my nursing education and cross the vaccine bridge when I get got there now you may be thinking doesn't everyone get vaccinated isn't it required understandably many people are confused that some parents would be hesitant about arguably the greatest public health invention of our time but over the past 20 years vaccine hesitancy has been growing typically vaccine hesitant parents delay or refuse vaccines due to their concerns for most pediatric providers this is something we encounter on a daily basis and frankly many of my health care counterparts are very frustrated by this writing that first blog post was pivotal for me not only did I admit that I was once vaccine hesitant but I had changed my mind I'm the oldest of four children born two loving parents when I was a baby my mom vaccinated me due to her pediatricians recommendation then she vaccinated my little sister by the time my second sister was born the voice of the vaccine hesitant movement was growing and as a result she received very few vaccinations by the time my brother was born he received almost none at all now as I found myself pursuing my master's degree in coming up with topics for my thesis I wanted to write about what I had heard from the vaccine hesitant community in which I had grown up I was ready to study the adverse effects of vaccinations and all the children suffering from them I wanted to represent those opinions to the scientific community I was now a part I confided my thoughts to one kind professor who simply told me that if I wanted to complete my thesis on that topic I better start researching her words were void of ridicule and judgment she just told me to do the work so I did and that's when I started to change my mind I couldn't find enough substantiated peer-reviewed evidence to indicate that vaccines were harming children but I was learning a lot about the power that vaccines have to save lives this was further validated once I was personally responsible for caring for children with preventable infectious disease I studied a child whose arms and legs had been amputated after meningitis nearly cost him his life I monitored a five week old in the hospital with pertussis desperately hoping that she would get better I admitted a toddler to the ICU with such severe dehydration from rotavirus that his pale limp body was nearly lifeless before being revived and I saw the devastation in his mother's eyes when she realized a vaccine she had turned down would have prevented his illness I even met a distant relative who had been paralyzed most of his life on account of polio no longer weary of giving vaccines I pursued the field of Pediatrics without pause it would be several years before I returned to the idea of writing about vaccines publicly with that first post on kid nurse and I was met with comments like these it would be fair to say that I had experienced the full force of the vitriolic online vaccine debate I had one and a half million readers come to kid nurse that first year and I was so disheartened by the amount of hate and anger but as you can see the hate and anger didn't just come from people that were against vaccines the animosity is definitely two-sided I encountered some who are very dogmatic in their activism for vaccinations they came across in some of their comments as though they are carrying the banner of vaccine science with an almost righteous fervor perhaps the issue with this group was not the principles of vaccine science but the delivery of their message dogmatism is the tendency to lay down principles is incontrovertibly true without consideration of evidence or the opinions of others but here's the problem good science is not dogmatic the reason we love science is because it's ever-evolving morphing into more and more discoveries of the world around us I am thankful that these advances include vaccines we still have terrible infectious diseases plaguing our planet I believe wholeheartedly that science will unlock more vaccine cures for a dying and broken world the same power that eradicated smallpox controlled the ravage of polio measles diphtheria and so many others will allow us to tackling malaria HIV possibly even Alzheimer's can you even imagine how that could change the world but with this overwhelming power that science holds we have to also acknowledge that it can unlock flaws no biological agent will ever be perfect immunizations are not an exception to this because of that history and our inability to ever achieve perfection we cannot become arrogant with our vaccination beliefs the vaccine debate in America is undeniably broken what I've learned is that the science speaks for itself but kindness speaks even louder what if we could depolarize the discussion so that the very parents that need to learn the most about vaccinations weren't scared away what if we believed that the way we communicate about vaccines is equally important as the information we deliver vaccinating your children just because your pediatric provider tells you to is not necessarily the modem of improper Rinda anymore we have to acknowledge that many people in this current generation of parents are fearful of vaccines it's time to change the conversation what if this was not about being Pro vaccine versus anti vaccine how do you truly even define those groups pushing people into one category or the other is not accurately identifying parents viewpoints in many cases I believe these categorizations go beyond mislabeling to become a villain ization of well intended parents in practice I find that parents generally fall into three categories vaccine advocates are parents who believe in vaccines strongly enough that they advise family and friends to vaccinate as well vaccine compliant parents vaccinate due to school or state requirements or the professional or personal recommendation of others but they may still have unvoiced or unanswered questions about vaccines and vaccine hesitancy delay or refuse vaccines until their concerns are resolved what if we could stop reducing the vaccine debate to an all-or-nothing conversation parents can fall into different categories of vaccine acceptance regarding different immunizations just because we hear a mother who has a concern about one vaccine doesn't mean that she has a concern about all of them when we hear concerns from parents we have to resist automatically assuming that they're resistant to all vaccines and just because a parent is fearful or confused about vaccines doesn't make them a bad person or bad parent I was not a bad person when I was vaccine hesitant my parents were not bad parents when they were vaccine hesitant parents should individually assess and ask questions about all vaccines as they seek to protect their children health care providers need to support them with information and support and compassion as they do this as I've personally learned sometimes change takes time the vaccine debate always boils down to this question what is the risk and what is the benefit I really started to change my mind about vaccines when I looked at the ratio of risk to benefit this is the real numbers behind what so often gets lost in the yelling and insults first I had to learn that the true risk of giving vaccines is so small it's almost incalculable what if we could teach parents that they risk far more by putting their children in the car and driving them to the pediatric office then actually giving them immunizations when they got their parents should also know that their children are a hundred times more likely to be struck by lightning than to have a serious vaccine reaction the immunization schedule does not overload the immune system we now protect against twice as many diseases as we did in the 1980s with a 97% less load on the immune system due to the decreased antigen count in today's vaccines and finally everyone needs to know that vaccines do not cause autism in the thousands of vaccines I have given to children I have never seen a serious adverse reaction and then we have the benefits they are very calculable vaccines save the lives of 6 million children across the world every year but what does that really mean to us especially here in America when most of us have never seen such diseases before that death toll will always be a far away number until we understand the unspeakable importance of one one infant with pertussis struggling to breathe the sound of those gasps for air once experienced can never be unheard one child forever disabled one child with cancer whose health is left to the mercy of those who hold the power to vaccinate one look into the eyes of grieving parents parents who would do anything to go back and make a different decision now that they know a vaccine could have avoided so much pain and suffering you don't understand vaccines until you understand the people they save I know because I've seen it I've walked through these devastating situations with real patients and real families every one of those situations changed my world for example these are some of the children of friends who have been personally impacted by preventable infectious diseases this sweet little boy contracted the measles after a family trip to Disneyland he was only four months old at the time this brave brave boy has spent over half of his life fighting cancer to citing not to vaccinate directly impacts hurt immunity which directly impacts him and this beautiful beautiful baby contracted pertussis also known as whooping cough this is one of the last pictures his mother took with him before he passed away the plausible risk of damaging lives through vaccinations is so small next to the comparison of saving the lives of millions of children there is no comparison you know what I pray for each of the parents I work with I pray that they never ever see the day that they have to bury a child that they never experienced the permanent paralyzing grief of death you know who also prayed the same prayer every generation of parents preceding us who came face-to-face with deadly infectious disease vaccines are the very solution that they fought and prayed so hard for I've decided that I'm not going to be so tricked into fearing the solution that I forget the enemy that infectious disease is to our children I'm a healer I've spent half of my life studying and working to fix children and their families it's a gift but it comes at a cost in its essence my job is to fix childhood death and disease that's devastating because children aren't supposed to die they're not supposed to face crippling illness and families are not supposed to face the despair of this reality but they still do practicing pediatric medicine means that we will do anything and everything we can to fight death and disease in the lives of the children we serve we stand in the gap we believe for the best we accept the crying broken exhausted parents and tell them that they are stronger than they know we reject guilt we empower parents to be the leaders that their children need we are the resounding voice that says it's going to be okay and as Henry Beecher said we believe that children are the hands by which we take hold of heaven whether it's stewarding the piece of heaven that they bring to us or rarely assuring it back we love children we don't do Pediatrics because it's job we do it because we love it ultimately I changed my mind about vaccines because I discovered they're one of the strongest tools I have to accomplish my mission I believe in vaccines because I can tell you the cost of losing our children to preventable infectious disease is incalculable sure we have the numbers history tells us that vaccines have saved millions but honestly what I've learned in practice has taught me that saving the life of one child is enough thank you [Applause]",

            "transcript": " Velouria are you gonna be a good girl? Hey friends! Today I want to talk about kittens immune systems and vaccines Oh my gosh If your fostering or adopting a kitten, it's your job not to just care for them when they get sick But to give them preventive care, which stops them from getting sick in the first place. So today I'm going to talk about one of the most important preventive care measures we can take Giving kittens vaccines Why are you so bitey? Tiny but bitey But before we talk about vaccines, let's talk a little bit about the immune system The immune system is an incredible bodily system that all mammals have, including cats, dogs, And even you and me. Think of the immune system as an army that's there to fight for you When there's a virus or bacteria that enters your system The army is made up of little green army men called antibodies, which are designed to tackle the threats that enter your body Healthy adults will have a large army to help keep them well, but when you're a newborn you hardly have any defence at all When a kid was born they have virtually no immune system So they have to borrow some assistance from their mother in the form of maternal antibodies The only opportunity these kittens truly have to get those maternal antibodies is to consume colostrum Colostrum is a natural component of breast milk which is rich in immunoglobulins which deliver passive immunity to the kitten It's like a temporary defense loan from the mother's own immune system that keeps the kitten safe for the first weeks of life But there are some problems with this system. For starters the colostrum phase of lactation Only lasts one week after the cat gives birth, an even bigger problem Is that newborn kittens can only absorb colostrum through the gut for the first 18 hours of life After that point that gut closes and forms a barrier, so they can't absorb colostrum through the gut anymore That's why it's so critical that newborn kittens nurse during the first hours of life Right Barnaby? So understanding how the immune system works It's easy to see why so many kittens are at risk and animal shelters and on the streets. If the kittens in a high-volume Environment with a lot of different animals like a feral cat colony or an animal shelter They're going to be exposed to a lot of different viruses that their bodies are not prepared to take on This is like putting a kitten into a war zone with no army to fight for them Clearly, unvaccinated kittens need our protection even more They need to be guarded from viral and bacterial agents that can hurt them, then kept in a confined safe space like a foster home As kittens get a little older they can get vaccinated. A vaccine helps give kittens immunity So it's like helping them suit up with armor. That's going to protect them for months to come There are two main vaccines that kittens will receive. The first is a series called the FVRCP vaccine This is a combination vaccine that protects against some of the most deadly viruses out there Rhinotracheitis, calicivirus and panleukopenia These are horrible viruses that are totally preventable through vaccination the FVRCP vaccine is a series Which means that you don't just get one They get a series of vaccines that help boost their immunity. The second vaccine that every kitten will get is the rabies vaccine Which protects against the rabies virus are other vaccines available But they're not generally recommended unless the kitten is at specific risk for those diseases However the FVRCP vaccine and the rabies vaccine are considered core vaccines Which means that every single kitten should be receiving these vaccines. So all of these are preventable diseases And we want to protect these kittens and cats Through vaccinations. Make sure that your adult cats in your home are vaccinated too. Here we go Easy-peasy Gotcha Gotcha! The vaccination schedule is going to vary depending on the specific event or program So always follow the medical advice of the team that you're working with. Different programs have different Protocol because it all depends on the risk to the individual kitten. For instance a high volume animal shelter might start vaccinating As young as four weeks of age But a private practice vet might tell you to start vaccinating at eight weeks It really depends on the program. Winston is a perfect example of when I vaccinate my kittens He's six weeks old and today is his first vaccine I personally start vaccinating at six weeks of age, and then I boost every two to three weeks It's important to know that maternal antibodies can impact the efficacy of a vaccine So depending on how much passes immunity the kittens obtained from their mother Vaccines might not be entirely effective until they've reached 12 to 16 weeks of age To ensure that there's been no antibody interference Adopters should continue booster shots until the kitten has reached 16 weeks Ok buddy Good job, that's it! Good boy, that was easy After that it's just an annual booster Now let's talk about the rabies vaccine. The rabies vaccine is generally given at 12 weeks of age so sometimes It's done once the kittens already been adopted. The rabies vaccine is required by law in many states So make sure you know your local laws. After the first rabies vaccine, it's boosted in one or three-year increments Even if you think a kitten is at very low risk of contracting rabies It's still an important vaccine for them to get. You'll need proof of rabies Vaccination if the kitten ever becomes impounded, goes to a boarding facility or bites somebody It's a really really good thing to have a record of Once you're ready to get a kitten vaccinated it's time for you to go to a local clinic. The good news is that if you're fostering for a Rescue or animal shelter, they will do all your vaccinations for you They let you know when it needs to be done and where to go and they'll even pay for the cost of the preventative care So if you're working with a local organization Just be sure to ask them what the vaccine schedule is and where you need to take them If you're raising a kitten on your own, you'll want to go to a local vet Many communities have a low-cost vaccine clinic that can do your vaccinations for super cheap so hop on Google type in \"Low-cost vaccine clinic\" and the name of the area that you live And find out what resources are available near you. If you run a rescue Organization or you're vet tech or you're trained to do vaccines, you can do the FVRCP vaccine at home However, this is not something you should ever do without training and you can't learn how to do it from a video. You should really be trained in person by a professional If you want to learn how to administer FVRCP vaccines at home Talk to your medical professional and see if they'll train you how to do it We do our FVRCP vaccines right here at our home And we do our rabies vaccines on-site at a vet. A veterinary clinic always has to do your rabies vaccine If you're going to be doing FVRCP vaccines at home ensure that you're using them safely and in accordance with rules and regulations with sterile supplies and under the guidance of a veterinarian And that's it! Now you know all about why vaccines are important, what vaccines they need And when, and where to go get them. Of course make sure that you're keeping good records of their vaccines And going back in for their booster shots. By taking good preventive care measures for these little guys We are setting them up for a lifetime of success. Thanks for keeping kittens healthy and best of luck! You did it! You got your vaccine! You did a good job!",

            "transcript": " Hi, I'm Megan and today we're here with Becky, who is a CVT and VTS in clinical practice and we're visiting Rose City Veterinary Hospital, and today Becky is going to talk about vaccinating this puppy. So this is Hilo, and he belongs to one of our receptionist here, and he's in the middle of his puppy series. So he is due for his third DAP. His distemper Parvo Adenovirus vaccine and his bordetella. So those are two that we will give together and then he'll come back in three weeks and he'll get his rabies so we can break all of those up. So for vaccines, the distemper vaccine is going to go in the right shoulder. The bordetella vaccine goes in the left shoulder, so on the opposite side, and then if we were vaccinating for rabies, it would be the right rear. And then lepto goes in the left rear. So, four different spots for four different vaccines, so we're not putting them all together. So, for him I'm going to draw up his bordetella and his distemper parvo and we give the bordetella last because the injectable one can sting so, it's not it's not uncommon for them to cry a little bit, or even start scratching at that area, because it stains a little bit. So, what we'll do first is we'll draw up the DAP vaccine. Because this is freeze-dried, we have to mix it up, and you only use the diluent that comes with it from the manufacturer. So, draw up all of the diluent, which it's about 1 ml, and then inject that right into the other vile, and then just mixing this up, because, you want all of this to be dissolved before you draw it back up into your syringe, so there's no clumps in there. And then, for this, you're just drawing this right back up. And then we do always change the needle. And he's such a little guy that we're going to go with the 25 gauge needle, and then I'm going to go ahead and draw up the bordetella as well, so that we have both them ready, and because these little labels peel right off, if we're giving more than one vaccine, we'll just peel it off and put it right on there so we remember which one is which. And then the bordetella, the injectable one, does not have to be mixed, whereas the intranasal one does so again, same thing, we are just going to draw this right up and then change the needle again. And then I'm going to put the label back on the syringe, just because we have this temperature still, so that nothing gets confused. And then because he's current on his his exam, all he needs is just a tech appointment with a vaccine so we're just going to take his temperature make sure he doesn't have any kind of fever. So we'll see if Megan can restrain this baby, and then, I'm sorry oh my goodness you're such a good boy so temp, is 101.6 so we are done with that, and then with the puppies, what we try to do is give them a food distraction or treat distraction, because every time they come in here has a puppy they're getting poked, and so we're trying not to make them associate us with bad things that happen. So, what he gets is, he's going to get a little bit of kong paste on a little tongue depressor, and hopefully that will distract him long enough. So what we'll start with is the DAP. Hi buddy, you want to focus on that? And we're going to go on this side, just a little bit lower than his shoulder, and hopefully he won't jump. Good job, and then we're drawing back, and injecting, and this is not the one that stings. Good job. And that is it for that one. So now we're going to do the bordetella, and we're going to be on the other side, so making still distracting him, and all the vaccines go sub-q. And we're just going a little bit lower than his shoulder area. Oh good boy, and then he might cry, because, this is the stingy one. Or he's going to be super brave. And he was so brave. And that's bordetella and DAP in a puppy.",

actually a request that one of my patreon subscribers had asked for which is a perfect segue into the next point please remember that I make these videos on my own time for free I'm trying to keep up with a huge list of topics that have been requested it's not easy to produce the videos narrate the videos I mean I make the slides from scratch I make all of the little pictures that's all me and it takes a lot of time and I'm not complaining about it but what I'm saying is that when there's an opportunity for you to pay hundreds and thousands of dollars for all these other crappy resources and you have the opportunity to learn for free here on YouTube with what I believe is really quality education it's really appreciated when you sign up to support me on patreon so in the description of every single video you'll see a link and that link is patreon.com slash dirty medicine and if you click that link it'll take you to my patreon page on patreon you'll be able to sign up and provide a secure monthly donation to help support dirty medicine and my channel it can be any amount that you want or one of the preset amounts that I've already put on the website but basically you choose any amount you want from one dollar to a million dollars if you're filthy rich and you send it to me monthly and it helps support the channel it keeps me motivated it helps fund all of the production of these videos so if you like the content here on dirty medicine please consider supporting me on patreon and that said if you have a video request I'm much more likely to try to actually expedite the process of making that request if you happen to be one of my patrons on my patreon page so with that said let's dive right into the topic for today again we're going to be talking about vaccines and here's an overview slide of everything that we're gonna cover we're gonna talk about the four different types of vaccines which you see here on this slide and as I go through this video we'll talk about the physiology of how these vaccines are working so we'll kind of describe what's happening on the immunological level we'll talk about some cautions or adverse reaction that you should be familiar with with with each of these different types of vaccines and then maybe even the highest yield part of this video is actually the different examples so we'll talk about the different viruses and bacteria that have vaccines in each of these four categories because unfortunately on USMLE and comlex it's fair game to have to know that information for example to know that smallpox is a live attenuated vaccine but that HPV is a subunit vaccine so you have to know what type of vaccine each of the different vaccines actually are and that's what I'm going to go through in addition to just all that background science that you need to know so let's go through these topics these different types of vaccines one at a time and by the end of this video you'll be an expert on the different types of vaccines the physiology and the examples so let's begin with live attenuated vaccines so personally I'm a huge advocate of looking at words looking at prefixes and suffixes to help you understand what a phrase or a medical term is referring to and if you didn't know what the word attenuated means if you look that up and do a google dictionary search what that word means is having been reduced in force effect or value so if you know the definition of attenuated and you think about the phrase live attenuated vaccine it makes perfect sense what these vaccines actually are so in a nutshell a live attenuated vaccine is a vaccine that contains a microorganism and that microorganism can still infect the host technically if it becomes introduced but generally speaking it's it's it had its pathogenicity taken away so it's safe to give it in a vaccine because typically we have enough immune response present to not let it go out of control but it'll induce a humoral and cellular response and that's what we want as the physicians and the scientists giving these vaccines some cautions that you should be aware of with a live attenuated vaccine is that the microorganism technically has the ability to revert back to its virulent form and what this means is that when you give somebody a live attenuated vaccine generally speaking in your normal person who has a normal immune this won't happen because you've taken the pathogenicity away from the microorganism however if you're gonna give this to somebody who's immunocompromised or pregnant it has the you know the ability to go and cause a very dangerous infection because even though you've taken away the pathogenicity of the microorganism that microorganism still does have the ability technically to infect the host once it's introduced so if you are gonna conceptualize this the bottom line here is that the live attenuated vaccines are technically the most risky because they can revert to their virulent form and really cause that infection and it's for this reason that it's usually contraindicated in pregnant patients and immunocompromised patients now that said the one really high-yield thing that you should know is that you can still give a live attenuated vaccine to an hiv-positive patient if they're not already immune to one of these live attenuated vaccines but in order to do so you have to ensure that their cd4 count is greater than 200 otherwise they could really become sick very quickly now what's the highest yield part of today's video it's knowing the examples of the different vaccines that correspond to each of these four categories so for live attenuated vaccines what are the examples well they're measles mumps rubella varicella polio and specifically the Sabin polio vaccine adenovirus the influenza or flu vaccine but only the intranasal version of it rotavirus and smallpox now I know what you're saying you're sitting there and you're watching this video and you just pooped in your pants and you you're like oh my god dirty I'm never gonna be able to learn this list what the heck man well it's actually a lot easier than this so I'm gonna reorganize this and give you my pneumonic so measles mumps rubella varicella polio adenovirus influenza rotavirus and smallpox the way that I've always remembered this going back years now is mmm really vivacious pairs of vaccines now why does this work well vivacious means lively and this is live attenuated vaccine so my pneumonic with the word vivacious is goes with the scenes because after all the term vivacious means lively so mmm really vivacious pairs of vaccines mmm mmm for measles and months the are in really for the are in rubella the V and vivacious for the V in varicella and again vivacious means lively and we're talking about live attenuated vaccines and then pears PA IR s for the P and polio the a in adenovirus the I in influenza and intranasal the are in rotavirus and the s in smallpox so when you're sitting there on test day and they ask you which of the following is a live attenuated vaccine you're gonna go live lively means vivacious mmm really vivacious pairs of vaccines and you're gonna remember exactly what the examples of the live attenuated vaccines are you're welcome I just got you all a free point on test day crushing it that's it guys that's all you need to know for live attenuated vaccines let's move on to the killed also known as inactivated vaccines so a killed or an inactivated vaccine you can see it referred to as either killed or inactivated means the same thing in this case what's happening is you get a humoral response and typically they take the pathogen the scientists do and the pathogen gets inactivated and that can happen either through chemical means or like hyper heating something to extreme temperatures and you heat it or you chemically you know mess with it I guess I'm not the PhD here but you change it in such a way that it's inactivated and when that happens you get this humoral response but what's really interesting is that the surface antigen epitope the maintenance of that epitope is required for immunity so if there's some kind of if it gets messed up at all or there's some type of mutation it's your immunity can can wane okay so the takeaway here is that these are referred to as killed or inactivated because you take chemicals and heating processes and you kill or inactivate the pathogen and then when you do that you put it in the vaccine you give it to the host and you induce this humoral response again remember and it's very high-yield I should have put it read that that surface antigen epitope you have to maintain it on the surface in order to get that immune response because the body is only seeing the surface of these kill pathogens now what are the cautions here well it requires boosters throughout your life boosters are usually required in types of vaccines that are that are technically weaker so if it induces a weaker immune response then you give these boosters because you're trying to boost that immune system every so many years and again sort of I've already touched on this but it's a technically weaker immune response for the reason that it's killed by a chemical and heating and the body's only recognizing the surface antigen epitopes now what are the types of killed or inactivated vaccines well it's hepatitis A rabies influenza but in this case the intramuscular form so the the internet' so we already talked about the intranasal form was live attenuated but the intramuscular forms of the needle that's killed and then the Salk subtype of polio vaccine so again we talked about one type of polio vaccine the Sabin which was in live attenuated but the Salk polio vaccine is killed now how do you remember this well when you think of someone who's been killed you think of them being buried in a graveyard and you say rest in peace or r.i.p so in the killed or inactivated vaccines these always rest in peace they always a for always for the a and hepatitis a are in rest for the are in rabies the I in in for the I in influenza or intramuscular and the P and peace for the P in polio so killed vaccines always rest in peace because they're killed so when someone's killed they rest in peace that's really it not that many to know here easier to memorize I would say than the live attenuated vaccines but something that's really important that you should take away from this video that that's incredibly high yellow die I don't ask me why but it shows up all the time are these two different types of polio vaccines so you've got the salt and the Sabin okay and you need to know which one is live attenuated and which one is killed and easy ways to know this so basically the K in sulk stands for the K and killed and you can either do process of elimination and only memorize that or if you want to take it one step further the in at the end of Sabin save in for enthusiastic or lively right so someone who's really enthusiastic is really lively so the Sabin vaccine is live attenuated so Sabin for enthusiastic lively live and the K in Salk for the K and killed so know which one goes into which category I don't know why it's so high yield but don't ask me test writers just love it so that's what you need to know for killed or inactivated vaccines and at this point in the video we've now gone through half of the material that you need to know and the truth is is that the last two on this slide the subunit vaccines which we'll talk about next and the toxoid vaccines which will conclude with at the end of this video are a lot easier than the two that we've already talked about so you're kind of cruising now so let's talk about the subunit vaccines so I think this is probably best illustrated with a little picture that I made so let's imagine that you have this pathogen pathogens have lots of different antigens on their surface that the body recognizes and the triggers our immune system and when scientists make the subunit vaccines what they do is they take the pathogen and they look for the one specific antigen that best stimulates the immune response in the human body and they isolate that specific antigen and then put that in the subunit vaccine and that's where the term subunit comes from they're taking one subunit or one antigen that preferentially activates immune responses and that's what the vaccine is made of so on this pathogen surface let's say that there's a specific antigen which on this slide is depicted by the green triangle they take that and they put it in the vaccine and an example of what a specific antigen could be would be like the capsular polysaccharide that they take off of encapsulated bacteria such as Neisseria meningitidis strep pneumonia and hemolysis influenza type B because those are all encapsulated bacteria and by introducing this in as a subunit in a subunit vaccine it Firenze the immune system to target those encapsulated bacteria so again the physiology here is that we're taking a specific antigen subunit the best activates the immune system and this really has a very low chance of adverse vaccine reactions because it's so specifically targeted that it there's really nothing else that can happen here some cautions will these tend to cost more money that obviously won't show up on your exam but it's just good to know and these do induce an arguably weaker immune response as far as the different types of subunit vaccines you see them here hepatitis B strep pneumoniae Neisseria meningitidis h influenza type v pertussis and human papilloma virus or HPV now the the mnemonic here is kind of tricky I'll say this is probably my most esoteric mnemonic that I'm gonna put in this video and the reason that I'm doing it is because these are a really random assortment of pathogens that are included in the subunit category before I even get into this what you could just memorize if you're trying to conserve the limited amount of brain space that you have for us Emily or comlex is that subunit vaccines target encapsulated bacteria because if you know the three encapsulated bacteria that I've already mentioned s pneumonia n meningitidis and H influenza type B you're probably going to get most if not all of these questions correct but if you really want to go the extra mile and know that hepatitis B pertussis and HPV are also in this category then here's my silly mnemonic so when I think of subunit I'm gonna rearrange these pathogens that you see here and instead of subunit I think about the B unit and to me the B unit sounds like a gang so I say that the B unit vaccines are cap in your ass I just imagine like this gang known as the B unit and they go around capping people right old school gang B unit the B unit gang so the B unit vaccines are cap in your ass now what is this pneumonic tell you well B unit B for hepatitis B the UN unit for the U in new monia the N in unit for the N in N Judis the I for influenza type B the T for the T and pertussis and the V in vaccines for HPV and the reason that I'm use cap in your ass cap'n is a slang term for like you know murdering or something it's because these are used to target the encapsulated bacteria so I think of cap'n or cap like encapsulated so I know it's really stupid mnemonic I apologize but if you're really looking for something here then this is what I used and you know it worked so that's that's it for the subunit vaccines let's conclude by talking about toxoid vaccines so the way that a toxoid vaccine works is basically really well depicted on this image that I found on the Internet so step one get the bacteria and in this case the example is showing diphtheria step two is take the toxin from the bacteria step three is denature that toxin modify it but be sure to leave the receptor binding site in place so this is really cool right they take the bacteria get the toxin from it and then basically modify the toxin just a little bit so that it doesn't cause the disease but is still it still looks like the toxin so that our immune system would recognize the toxin if it recognizes the toxoid so if if you don't know this the the the term boyd at the end of words means like so toxoid means like a stalks in anything that has lead at the end means it's that like right so opioid is like an opiate toxoid is like a tox in so that's where that phrase comes from so again toxoid vaccines are like toxins and that makes sense because if you look at the physiology here of what's going on you're taking the toxin and you're just changing it a little bit and you're making the vaccine like the toxin which is why it's called toxoid so the physiology again everything I just said bacterial toxin is adapted and you have to leave that intact receptor binding site this does cause an antibody response but it doesn't cause the disease cautions here these do require some boosters over time there's only two toxoid vaccines that you need to know so this is pretty easy memorize this is Clostridium Tecna and Kearney bacterium diphtheria so tetanus and diphtheria shouldn't be that hard to memorize but just in case you do need a mnemonic toxoid starts with T ends with D tetanus and diphtheria for T and D so guys ladies gentlemen and anybody else who does not identify there you go you now know the include live attenuated killed aka inactivated subunit and toxoid if you're going to learn one thing from this video because you don't feel like memorizing everything that I went through just know the different examples in which category they fall into but if you want to be a really well-spoken a knowledgeable physician and then I do advise you to know everything can contained in this video so that's it click the link in the description sign up to be a patron of dirty medicine love you all good luck",

            "description": "Ethan Lindenberger never got vaccinated as a kid. So one day, he went on Reddit and asked a simple question: \"Where do I go to get vaccinated?\" The post went viral, landing Lindenberger in the middle of a heated debate about vaccination and, ultimately, in front of a US Senate committee. Less than a year later, the high school senior reports back on his unexpected time in the spotlight and a new movement he's leading to fight misinformation and advocate for scientific truth.\n\nGet TED Talks recommended just for you!

            "transcript": " Translator: Wall Piercing Translator: Bruce Sung  As a beginning, I want to share my hometown with you  Norwalk, Ohio  Well, as mentioned earlier, I\u2019m from Norwalk  It is a very small town with a population of about 15,000  Seriously, in Novak, if you want to have some fun  You can visit the Wal-Mart supermarket or drive for half an hour to find more interesting things to do  In Novak, where I grew up  I attended a local public high school  You know, this place is really great. I really like my town  I'm like a normal child, you know  Lead a debate club  Volunteer in church  Back in November 2018  I\u2019m posting a post on Hongdi, I hope everyone can give me some suggestions  I was facing an issue that needed someone to help me clarify  This topic, as mentioned in the introduction  It's about vaccination  And why I didn\u2019t get all kinds of vaccinations  Including polio and measles as well as flu, HPV, hepatitis  These vaccines that people my age may get  Okay, the question I posted is very simple and strange  Because yes i want to get vaccinated  It's kind of weird, but it just happened  Then this matter became a public issue  Just because i want to get vaccinated  That\u2019s a bit strange, and the incident continues to burn  I started to accept interviews and talk to many people  I repeat, I\u2019m an average kid, not a scientist  I'm just an ordinary person without leading a non-profit organization  I even wear a hoodie now  (laughter)  Due to my problem and the whole thing  Because i want to get vaccinated  And the interesting situation I was in at the time  I found that I was in  In public places where this extremely important issue occurs  Most of the reports and headlines I have seen are very correct  You know, \"Stand up against anti-vaccine mothers  Ohio youth explained why vaccinated. \"  Very correct, very real  And, as stated, when I testified before a Senate committee  The thing is, they said  \"This young man who vaccinated himself  Shatter his mother's belief in opposing vaccines before Congress. \"  Okay, I didn\u2019t really do that, but it\u2019s okay  And some news goes further  \"'God knows how I am still alive\":  The 18-year-old was finally vaccinated and criticized his anti-vaccination parents. \"  I didn't criticize my parents that the report was not accurate  That really made my story a controversy  Like my mom is bad and i'm kind  And I criticized her severely  None of this is true  None of this happened  I have never been rude to my mother  Even in public  When I explained that her philosophy was misled  I will emphasize that it is important to understand that she is a loving mother  Because many people, I think people in the scientific world  Understand the importance of vaccines  Will be puzzled by people who don\u2019t want to get vaccinated  Indeed, it\u2019s like someone refusing to send a child to the emergency room  Being in this environment is very dangerous  This also shows that there is a lack of empathy for children at some levels  Seriously, I can understand this, I can  But my mother was misled by some news,  The news convinced her loving parents that they would not vaccinate their children  However, when I learned about it accidentally, I talked to my mother  Not very smooth at the beginning  Because of what i want to do  She thinks that this incident will cause me to suffer from autism or be disabled for life  I said I wanted to vaccinate, but it didn\u2019t work  Not going well  But I found something interesting  When i'm in certain situations  During these interviews  I always have a question  Although not a constructive question:  What did i mess with myself  I keep asking myself  Because, once again, I am not a professional, but just an average child  But now I continue to discuss scientific issues on CNN and Fox News  That really is, should I continue? Should I continue to comment?  Many people question this and they have very legitimate reasons  However, I don\u2019t comment on things I don\u2019t understand  What I said is related to my personal experience  In the Senate public hearing  I only mentioned how dangerous the wrong message is  My mom gets many opinions from social media, whether it\u2019s Facebook  Or some organizations, the platform they use has not yet prohibited publishing false statements  Those speeches are very dangerous  I also saw a similar situation happen to me while I was speaking  I try my best to show respect  And keep it correct  There are many criticisms of me and many people who are very angry with me  To provide testimony, I went to Washington, DC  I remember when I was hanging around in the office building  Three ladies take the elevator with me  They said I was the culprit who caused the maim and death of their children  I'm no different from Hitler  Interesting  Really, in most cases most teenagers and most people  When criticized, they start to doubt  Doubt will cause doubt, and doubt will make people give up  Topics you are interested in  Or when the action you want to participate in appears  You take your stand and defend the truth  Because good ideas are not afraid of others\u2019 criticism  It is always tricky for very young people to face such things  These important issues that require young people to participate in discussions  A lot of effort  I'm not bragging about how great I am, but then the point is coming  Through my participation in this action and this important scientific discussion  These things happened  Facebook\u2019s platform is different  They change the way they deal with anti-vaccine related content  Amazon even removed books with incorrect information on autism and vaccination  Just recently, GoFundMe cancelled the anti-vaccination campaign  What we are talking about is how to make substantial changes through this type of action  Affect the game  Influencing deceptive error messages  Dangerous ideas that influence people to persuade  Now, I only have a short time left  I want you to keep an important thing in mind  This matter is far more important than other things  What you can do and what i did  I did not make painstaking investigations and studies  Not getting information and presenting it to people  I didn't struggle with others  Exhausted scientific discussion  I just share my story  Enough for most people  To understand some real people outside of the rumored data  Because the information does not resonate with people  But people will resonate with others  You must keep this in mind  When it comes to certain topics  You share your story, what is important to share  Maintain your credibility  Maintain data, credibility of information  On the importance of this issue  Suppose I talk to someone  They asked: \"Why is vaccination important?\"  I have no other answers  It will not give answers other than the following answers in any way:  Because people will die, it\u2019s important  The child will die, it's very important  It can also cause diseases that shouldn't happen  I believe, just like John. What Boyle said  These diseases should only appear in history textbooks rather than continue to exist in us  Because of this, you must be determined to defend the truth  Make up your mind  And said, \"This is correct, this is true  Those lies are bad. \"  This matter started from me personally  Not progress from town to senate in a day  It\u2019s not that after a nap, after getting up  Senator Isaacson is waiting to ask me questions about vaccination  This is a very long process, things will start because I said  \"This is real\"  \"Although my mother doesn't believe it, it doesn't matter.\"  Because the facts will not be different  The correct and important parts will not change  Seriously, the most important question is  This indestructible idea still cannot be broken  When you stand up for the truth, you will also criticize you  Don't be swayed when you try to do something  Thank you  (applause) ",
