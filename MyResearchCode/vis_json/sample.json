            "transcript": "  [Music] good morning friends I'm Andy Tibbitts nagas working in food safety and Standards Authority of India since last six years today I'm going to discuss genetically modified foods or GM foods which is commonly used in day to day language now what are GM's or genetically modified foods these may range from animal products which are from animal fed on GM feed products produced from the GM organisms or may also involve the insertion of DNA from one organism into another or modification of an organism's DNA into other to achieve a desired trait for example in the picture below you can see a fish resistance to froth for example resistant to frost and when its gene is incorporated into a strawberry that results in a strawberry resistant to frost so definitely it is proved that genetically modified foods are a benefits to human race but why these foods are genetically modified the reason is the genetic engineering offers a rapid and precise method of altering organisms as compared to traditional methods that are slow and inaccurate for example BT that is bacillus thuringiensis yellow squash or soy which proved to be a blessing to human race the other application of GM's are potato modified to produce a beetle killing toxin yellow squash which is widely are available across the globe which is modified to contain viral genes that are resistant to most of the common viral diseases it also develops foods that contain vaccines and antibodies that offer valuable protection against disease such as cholera hepatitis and malaria one more example is mustard or rapeseed which is modified to one type of herbicide or pesticide so how does GM and Mendel and his bees differs Mendel in his bees principle was selective breeding which is slow imprecise and in which modification of genes that naturally occur in the organism was found however in GM the process is very fast it is precise and can introduce genes into an organism that would not occur naturally so how this GM technology is done this can be best explained with the example of transgenic tomatoes in which a transgenic tomato resistant to spoilage is developed from a spoiled tomato DNA the picture behind is self explanatory so now once we have discussed what actually is genetic engineering and GM food that is now discussed its benefits it eases the world hunger by development of drops that can grow into marginal soils it reduces the strain on drawn renewable resources such as development of drought resistant crops development of salt tolerant crops and development of crops that make more efficient use of nitrogen and other nutrients it also uses low pesticides and herbicides which are beneficial for the soil in which agriculture is done it reduces the herbicide use for better environment and reduces the cost for the farmers it also results in improved crop quality by development of frost resistant crops development of disease resistant crops and by development of flood resistant crops the nutritional quality is also improved with help of genetic engineering by development of foods designed to meet specific nutritional goals now since this is such a beneficial technology for human race it is discussed who uses this technology to the most USA is the largest user of GM technology and genetically engineering crops followed by Argentina Canada and last but not the least China we are lucky or maybe unlucky in this regard that India is still to make its mark on the globe in the use in the of use of GM foods every technology has beneficial and non beneficial face it with respect to GM foods the risk associated are insects my developed resistant to pesticides producing GM crops herbicide tolerant crops may cross pollinate weeds resulting in super weeds which grow widely and a very fast pace certain gene product may be allergen thus causing harm to human health there may be unintended harm to wildlife and beneficial insects since GM seeds are patented it may reduce the competition in the market and also results in production of society seeds societies are nothing but plants with sterile seeds that are infertile or farmers are forced to buy these seeds everywhere so in the end how can we reduce that GM foods are good or bad for human race well it depends on individual and how we are using for our benefit consumers government and scientist should be responsible for weighing the benefits against the cost and we as an individual should be responsible for its wide use across the globe or it's reduced grow so after discussion what GM food is its benefit and its disadvantage what do we think is it good or bad for us well it depends to individual to individual in the end I can only say that use widely if used wisely thank you Oh",

            "transcript": "  I'm John John McFadden from the University of Surrey I am a firm believer that we should embrace genetically modified crops and food and the reason I believe that is I think they have the potential to provide an almost benefit to mankind they have more resistance to disease the crops and they can produce higher yields and there's a potential now of generating fortified foods and fortified crops that can really tackle some important diseases in the world the most famous of these of course is is the Golden Rice which has been shown to be able to provide the daily requirement for a vitamin a vitamin A deficiency is responsible for making half a million children each year go blind and within a year a third two-thirds of them are dead but I mean I'd like to like to go back a little and you know vitamin A deficiency around the world is an enormous problem but we need to go back and ask questions about what kind of agricultural systems we want and how we want them to operate these are economic and political questions they're not scientific questions and at the moment we have a system of giant industrial agriculture of monocultures of huge quantities of basically a very small number of crops that are coming through a very small number of sources at the moment 53 percent of the world's seeds come from three companies what we need is diverse multicultural crops all sorts of different crops happening together not the big monocultures and not the situation where it's controlled by big companies that farmers have to buy their seed every year fresh you know a considerable cost and also crops that are engineered in a way that relies on those companies selling agricultural chemicals to them so you're looking at a high cost high input system that's controlled by you know three companies but this is not specific to GM crops this is the situation in agriculture around the world today and it's a situation in lots of other industries most of our pharmaceuticals are produced by two or three or four or five different companies because everything we our clothes are made by multinational our computers and on today we're talking about our food supply this is the most absolute absolute essential thing now in the green party we're not opposed to GM research very much so but the fact is we've had three decades as john vidal of the guardian said we've had three decades and we've only got a handful of crops from GM and you know the evidence is that the in terms of yields that GM crops aren't keeping up with conventionally bred crops that's the evidence so we have a situation where this is technology that really hasn't worked after three days there are 14 million farmers in the world today who are using GM crops 90% of them are in the developing world most of them are small farmers now you either have to believe that they're all stupid or that they are getting some benefit from them and all the studies that have been done and really a lot of studies have been done show that farmers make rational decisions nobody forced them to choose to young crops they do but as well as that they're long but they should been realizing campaigns there are the potential health benefits of crops such as golden rice which are unarguable they are potentially huge and it's a it's a catastrophe every year they're half a million children are dying and f\u00e1tima native deficiency area when for at least a decade this solution has been available but has never been allowed to be tried out in field trials proper field trials because of the opposition of economics so actually yes you say they would need to be proper field trials so therefore we have we're not going to do this next year so it's very simplest of things going on at the moment in the Philippines and in other countries field size are going we're not talking about a magic solution but the field trial should have been a decade ago and they haven't weren't a decade ago because people like the Green Party and everyone else opposed the general public is concerned because if people are jumping up and down and saying this is going to kill you people will get concerned I'm saying they're at work with reason and logic I think in this world and if you want to stop people from doing something there should be good reasons and you're seem to be ideological on the basis of you're against capitalism and again well I think lots of people who against Monsanto in most parts of Africa for instance people use organic farmer because it's all there is and 30% of their crops get eaten by insect when they switch to GM crops that goes down to a much a fraction that's why farmers in India Africa and places are now taking up GM crops what you want to say is they are stupid and I'd listen to doing we're saying is we want to provide them with a wide range alternate even though you didn't want to run it you want to ban it you don't want you don't want to give them the choice isn't that correct and what we want to do is see that you see that there's no release a video without your profiles which there isn't at the moment and what we want to do also we see that everything if there is GM crops out there that it's labeled so that consumers have the choice of knowing what they can choose",

            "transcript": " \"Genetically modified organisms\" is one of the most controversial aspects of science.  Genetic engineering is used in several areas. Although its medical uses  Widely accepted as genetically modified insulin  The dispute grows when we come to food and agriculture  why is that?  Why the same is treated differently?  Let's try to come to an end and explore the facts,  And fears,  And..  The Future of Genetically Modified Organisms  [Music provided]  What is the meaning of natural?  Humans have genetically modified plants and animals for thousands of years.  Perhaps some of your crops had a plentiful output.  Perhaps one of your wolves was particularly loyal.  So you do the smart work, and you raise animals and plants that have useful properties for you.  \"Characteristics\" are simply the result of genes.  So, with each generation,  These useful properties are becoming increasingly popular.  After thousands of years,  Most of the animals and plants around us are very different.  If humans have been modifying genes since the last millennia,  What makes a \"genetically modified organism\" different now?  \"Selective breeding\" is basically just a game of luck  Genetic engineering eliminates this luck factor  We can choose the qualities that we want  Make fruit grow larger ...  Immune to pests, and others  So why are people worried about this?  Are GMOs bad?  Let's start with one of the most common objections to GMOs  \"Gene flow\" means that genetically modified crops can mix with traditional crops to produce unwanted new properties  There is a way to ensure that this is completely prevented,  But the method itself is highly controversial by opponents of GMOs  \"Sterile seeds\"  The idea is that they can produce sterile plants, requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year.  However, this idea led to public outrage and public protests, causing the technology to stop.  This brings us back to the unintentional spread of the modified genes  There are cases of growth of \u201cgenetically modified organisms\u201d in places where they have not been grown, and traces of modified genes found in different crops.  But \"genetically modified plants\" cannot spread freely.  Many crops pollinate themselves.  All crops must be of the same type to mate  There are control methods such as \"buffer zones\" to keep unwanted immunization rates at the lowest levels  But if GMOs can inadvertently mate GMOs  This raises a more important question  Is food from GM crops different from food from non-GM crops?  This question has been a concern from the beginning  Edible GM plants are screened for potential hazards, and the results are evaluated by different agencies.  After more than 30 years of research and thousands of studies, science says its word  \"Eating GM plants is no more dangerous than eating non-GM plants\"  But do not take our word and make sure yourself, the sources and references of the study are found in the description below the video.  But what about plants that have been modified to be poisonous?  For example, botanical botanical crops \"BT crops\".  A gene, borrowed from turing bacilli, stimulates modified plants to produce a protein that destroys the digestive system  The plant makes its own insecticide  The insects you eat die immediately.  That sounds terrifying!  Pesticide spray can be washed  While the poison in the seeds of bacillus Thuringia is inside the plant.  But in fact, that's not a real problem  Poison remains a relative matter  What is harmless to some kind, may kill another  Coffee for example is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us  Or take chocolate as an example, it is dangerous for dogs but delicious for humans  Turing bacilli crops produce a protein that fits the specific digestive system of some insects.  But it is completely harmless to us  There is also an opposite approach  Plants engineered to resist some deadly herbs  This method enables farmers to use them extensively, killing other plants competing for resources without harming the crop.  Here we get to the dark side of (GMOs - GMOs)  The pesticide industry is a big business  Over 90 percent of US commercial crops are resistant to herbicides, mostly glyphosate  As a result, the use of glyphosate has increased dramatically  This is not only bad. Glyphosate is less harmful to humans than other herbicides  Therefore, farmers have a strong incentive to rely only on this method, and throwing more balanced ways to manage weeds aside.  This is one of the biggest fundamental problems in discussing GMOs  Most of the criticism of this technology is actually criticizing modern agriculture and doing business for the huge companies that control our food supply.  This criticism is not only true, it is also important.  We need to change the farming system to a more stable system  Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) as a technique are in fact an ally, not an enemy, in that battle  Help save and protect nature and reduce our impact on the environment  What can good GMOs do?  Let's see some positive examples  Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh but often the crop is completely destroyed by pests  Farmers relied heavily on insecticides  It wasn't just expensive,  But farmers also got sick  The introduction of the new genetically modified eggplant in 2013 stopped this  The same turing bacilli protein that we talked about before was an effective insect killer but harmless to humans, it was engineered in crops  This reduced the consumption of pesticides on eggplant by more than 80%, increased the health of farmers and increased their income significantly  Sometimes genetic modification is the only option  In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was attacked by the Ringspot virus, which threatened to kill the Hawaiian papaya.  The solution was genetically modified papaya where it was vaccinated against the virus  Otherwise, the papaya industry in the country would have collapsed  \"the future\"  All these stories show a very narrow application  99% of all GMOs we use now produce pesticides or are resistant against pests  There's so much to do  Scientists are working on genetically modified organisms that can improve our diet  Plants that produce more or different nutrients, such as fruits, have higher levels of antioxidants that help fight disease  Or rice with extra vitamins  More broadly, we are trying to engineer plants to be able to adapt to climate change  Plants better adapt to irregular weather and adverse soil conditions  Making them resistant to drought or flooding.  \"Genetically modified organisms\" can not only reduce the impact of agriculture on the environment, but actively help protect them  Scientists are working on crops that may extract nitrogen from the air like microbes  Nitrogen is a common fertilizer but its accumulation pollutes groundwater and accelerates climate change  Plants that collect their nitrogen can solve two problems at once  Excessive use of fertilizers in developed countries as well as shortages in developing countries  We can also improve plants to be more effective in collecting carbon, such as the American chestnut tree to mitigate and actually reverse climate change.  With the tools that we have today we can imagine anything  Conclusion  The world eats 11 million pounds (4989516070 kg) of food every day  The UN estimates that we will need 70% more by 2050  This food can be made by removing more and more forests to create fields and pastures, and by using more pesticides  Or we find a way to do it on land that we now have with more effective methods like genetically modified crops  Intensification rather than expanding agriculture means that GMOs become new natural beings  In short, GMOs do not have the ability to change agriculture radically  But also to mitigate the effects of our irresponsible behavior  \"Genetic modification\" can become our strongest weapon to protect our biosphere  This clip took more than 600 hours for his work, which would have been impossible without the support of viewers on patreon.com  If you want to support carefully researched content made with love, it's really very helpful  And you can get your own bird as a reward  If you want to know more about genetic modification we have more videos that explain the opportunities and risks and how they can affect our future ",

            "description": "The first ever commercially grown, genetically modified food was the Flavr Savr Tomato, produced over 15 years ago. Production of the tomato stopped after only about 3 years because of competition with the Long Shelf-Life Tomato. Since then, the only GM foods grown in the US other than staples (soybeans, corn, and cotton for cottonseed oil) are papaya and squash. This is partly due the general public's reticence to embrace GM technology\u2014a sentiment that, when examined, is based on little evidence of actual risk. But beyond the knee-jerk fear mongering, is there any reason to worry about the effects of more widespread consumption of GM food? Food experts Louise Fresco and Pamela Ronald help to tease apart truth from myth in the oft-misunderstood biotechnological food revolution.\n\nThe World Science Festival gathers great minds in science and the arts to produce live and digital content that allows a broad general audience to engage with scientific discoveries.

            "transcript": "  we have to go back to the beginnings of Agriculture and and in a way you could say any agriculture any selection of the seed for example from a wheat crop or a rice crop by a farmer to plant the next year was always selection and in a way genetic manipulation because you took some individuals and not others so we as humans have always been influencing the crops genetically and plant breeding in a classical sense was a way of combining two parents with different characteristics and get a new generation that was better that's what we always have done and to understand genetic mechanisms or genetic methods modern methods actually is the best way to look at it is as a very complex set of tools a toolbox that allows you to select the farmer precisely as Pam has described the genes that you want in the past as Monty was still doing by back crossing these two different types of rice you had to get in a lot of other genes that you didn't control so in a way this is a far more precise set of tools the problem I think is not with the toolbox the problem is with the end result many people are comfortable with using the tools but they're not comfortable if the end result is a genetically modified organism ie a plant or an animal that has genes that have somehow been manipulated and word itself is already charged to become something else which it wouldn't have become through so-called natural means and the whole thing hinges on what is natural I think the feeling I have and I think my colleagues as well is that this is a step in a process that hasn't been natural from the start if you want because we always wanted to have as humans desired characteristics now many people draw the line in the sense that they feel okay if I'm having a genetically modified rice like that like the Golden Rice which has so many good characteristics and it still comes close to what it what rice was before that's okay but if we start to build in say a gene from a fish as has been done in in in California to help cold tolerance or frost tolerance in strawberries that's going too far and that is indeed a fine line I would say the way to look at that is threefold it's the purpose for which you do the genetic manipulation it is whether the what it comes from a gene that is somehow close to the kind of crop or plant or animal you're talking about or when it's very wide cross are very very different thing more people have a problem with that and also whether the end justifies the means and I think there are two problems that people feel very strongly is what is the environmental risk and what is the human health risk well give us an idea about what environmental risk our health force might be because we hear the genetic manipulated foods Jamaicans with the human health risk and you have one has to formulate this very precisely the fact that so many hundreds of millions of Americans have been eating genetically modified soybean and maize and a couple of other things and we've not found any risks greater than what would occur naturally with the consumption of non genetically modified foods suggests that there is not a health risk that we can trace now however the absence of evidence of an additional risk is not the proof of the country it doesn't mean that therefore we can assume it safe but we can only assume it's within the kinds of risks that we see today nobody has gotten sick as far as we know in this country in other countries from eating a genetically modified organism however when we talk about the environmental risk the story is a little bit more complicated because we're not dealing with one other organism being men man or woman it is with a whole ecosystem and so particularly what happens in the soil for example or what a genes escaped as some people think what we know is that there is really no easy out crossing of genetically modified organisms for example with wild weeds there are no super weeds occurring right now but that risk is not to be excluded completely and certainly when you think of lower types of bacteria for example or organisms in the soil there may be an effect that we don't know yet and I feel very strongly that we should monitor the environmental side very carefully also internationally but so far actually the record is quite good there's another issue here that I want to add to all of this that is the general impression out there that genetically modified genetically engineered or manipulated foods are part of a whole system that also brings in large factory farming monocultures that there's a link between genetically modified foods and mono cultures which are susceptible to disease and also limit the biodiversity of our food sources just to make clear in the United States the situation is very different than it's predicted in other parts of the world so in the US the major genetically engineered crops are produced by major corporations corn soy cotton and in in other parts of the world they're expected to be crops like rice cassava maize that farmers would take care of themselves on the field so anyway just looking in the United States they found i'm tremendous reductions in insecticide so when people are looking at environmental risks for example we really need to think about the amount of insecticides that are used globally it's predicted that about 300,000 people die every year from overuse of insecticides three hundred thousand yes in California alone in the developed world we're seeing 1,200 pesticide poisonings every year and genetically engineered crops as they're used in the United States have dramatically reduced the amounts of",

            "transcript": "  little while back two poles were done one sample of the US public while the second sampled members of an organization that includes scientists and people interested in the science the pollsters use the results to determine where scientists and the public have the biggest differences in opinion you might expect it to be something political like evolution or climate change but it wasn't it was whether GMO foods are safe mashed potatoes and a special treat for them chocolate layer cake pills are they we use genetic engineering to give plants useful traits we've made crops that resist viruses or make proteins that kill the insect pests that eat them we've made other crops that aren't harmed by a weed killer and we've engineered rice to make an important vitamin golden race is being marketed as the cure the vitamin A deficiency a leading cause of blindness in the world these crops have lower pesticide use and increased farmers income in developing countries while an engineered crop is undoubtedly different all of our crops are very different from how they started our crops are hybrids of different strains with many random mutations both natural and made using radiation these GMOs have smaller and far more targeted changes than the crop strain does compared to its natural relatives but people have always been uneasy with starting back when we applied it to bacteria in the 1970s there one of the kinds of bacteria that caused food to spoil the controversy over genetic engineering followed two crops people worried about the spread of engineered genes into the environment the way GMO crops provide an advantage to large agricultural companies in our increasing reliance on just a few strains of plants for our food combined these worries have led to decades of protests including arson and destroyed crops due to all of this the use of GMOs in Europe has been severely limited in the US has even passed a law requiring foods containing GMOs to be labeled but politics isn't driving the problems Paul show equal concerns about GMO foods between conservative Republicans and Liberal Democrats so why are they wrong some of the controversy arises from issues related to whether a few companies have too much control over modern agriculture other issues focus on the danger of relying on a limited number of high yield crop strains that's not a problem specific to GMOs though it's just how agriculture works now genetic engineering involves inserting a short stretch of DNA into the genome of an organism in this case a plant that DNA will typically encode a couple of genes at least one of which provides a useful function like virus resistance the modified DNA itself isn't dangerous since the DNA of anything-we gets broken up in our digestive tract we also digest the proteins that the gene encodes but just in case we've tested whether these proteins cause allergies before the engineering goes ahead if GMO critics were right wouldn't we be seeing lots of health problems tied to their use yet GMO crops have now undergone decades of testing and use and no problems have been discovered while a few small studies have suggested a link between GMOs and cancers these studies have had glaring flaws too few animals inconsistent results and they've been impossible to repeat if the engineered proteins were doing anything in our bodies we probably see the effects during animal testing then we'd be seeing it in our cells along with all the other plant and animal DNA from our food absolutely none of these things have been seen well it is possible to make a GMO crop that isn't safe what economic reason would a company have for doing that sure there could be risks if people use the crops poorly it's possible that the engineered genes can spread to the wild relatives of the crops insects could develop resistance to some of the crops we've engineered but all things considered these risks can be managed and they're not risks to human health so why are people so afraid of GMOs one thing to consider is that fewer people than ever are involved in farming which means that fewer people directly reap the benefits of GMO crops most of those benefits go to farmers lots of people don't trust the companies that dominate modern agriculture finally some people may view genetic engineering as playing God and are uncomfortable with it there is in this at least a hint of the moral problems posed by modern genetics the leading poets professors and politicians could furnish genetic material for generations of offspring who was to decide religious dietary laws of the result of the deep-seated desire for food that's pure and natural I mean some of that's reasonable we all want our food processed under clean conditions but there's nothing natural about any of our crops remember what the ancestor of corn looks like given all these issues it's unlikely the public will accept the science anytime soon",

            "transcript": "  low fat gluten-free keto paleo vegan organic you can find just about any item in the grocery aisle tailored to your food preferences but no label is likely to cause as much debate as the one bearing these three letters G M o they stand for genetically modified organisms we have been eating genetically modified foods in one form or another since they were first approved 25 years ago scientists and health agencies agree genetically modified foods are as safe as any other foods we consume but there is an unease about genetic modification that is often fueled by how much we actually know about the science of it everything we eat has been genetically altered altered using some type of genetic technique so what our ancestors did 10,000 years ago was primitive genetic improvement where they would take you know a wheat plant that had some characteristics they like they would sell pollinate it they grow it they plant it and they'd slowly start to change the gene pool through this very slow process the most common way scientists alter a plant is by using a soil borne bacterium that has the ability to insert its genetic material into a plant's genome scientists modified that bacterium to insert a desired trait from another organism traits can include ones to make some crops resistant to specific insects or specific weed killers to withstand drought or flooding or using a fragment of a virus to make a plant immune to infection like a vaccine so plants get viral infections as do people and so as humans most of us hopefully all of us get immunized so this is mechanistically different but conceptually similar why plant breeders and farmers want to grow crops that have been you know sort of opponents argue this isn't natural and that there hasn't been enough long-term testing to prove there are no risks to consumers modern genetic approaches are no more risky than conventional approaches and in some cases one could argue that there's even less because they are well characterized and they're regulated so then Charlevoix from Dalhousie University specialises in risk indication in the food supply system he sides with the science but he says there's a good reason why so many people are uncertain about GMOs the biotechnology industry has always been educating farmers the industry itself but really forgot the consumer in the end and so all of a sudden it appeared in in their foods and of course surprises is something that consumers don't necessarily like especially when it comes to food safety and that's why there's been there's been this rebellion you won't find a lot of genetically modified foods in the produce section in Canada it's when you hit the process of food sections that you'll come across them corn soy canola and sugar beets they aren't the only genetically modified crops out there but they're the big ones check the ingredients list of any number of canned or packaged foods in the supermarket and they'll be there often under different names take corn for example it can be there in baking powder citric acid caramel coloring xanthan gum high fructose corn syrup dextrose and a whole array of ingredients sometimes lumped under words like artificial sweetener or natural flavors seventy-five percent of everything that's processed in a grocery store has at least one gently modified ingredients so it's really out there that's why there's a movement in Canada and the US for mandatory and transparent GMO labeling the non-gmo movement has decided to take take on a leadership role in labeling and that's why we're seeing more and more non products that are labeled non-gmo and it's been it's been somewhat successful even though the vast majority is don't even know what a GMO actually is I think if you if you are to go with a mandatory labeling policy related to genetically modified ingredients you would demystify the whole that the technology itself right now labeling in Canada and the US is voluntary you won't see many products on the shelves declaring they're made with genetically engineered ingredients but you will see plenty labeled a non GMO often bearing a seal like this declaring a product is verified non-gmo it's not an official certification from any sort of government health or food inspection agency the independent non-gmo project says its goal is preserving and building the non-gmo supply chain so of course GMO is meaningless and non GMO is even more meaningless so in the United States probably in Canada we have this little butterfly and you can buy non GMO salt - non GMO sugar and it's just a it's a sort of a label that people are selling just to give you an idea of how often this label is used we went on a little non-gmo grocery store scavenger hunt here we have juices cheese olive oil cat maple syrup sugar and even that non GMO salt dr. Ronald mentioned salt doesn't even have I prefer labels that are anchored to some kind of meaningful science and inspections there is a form of labeling coming forward in the US that scientists like dr. Ronald are getting behind requiring foods that are bioengineered or made from or derived from bioengineering to be labeled as such companies selling these products will also have to connect consumers with information about those ingredients you'll be able to scan exactly that'll bring down some fears some people understand it's gonna be anchored to real informations this form of labeling may not be enough to change the minds of diehard GM opponents but it could open up the discussion for other people who are on the it's about genetically modified food respecting the consumer is probably what's most important if you actually hide something you should expect a group of individuals to actually fight back or to react to the unknown what you put in your shopping cart is ultimately your choice well we're not likely to see genetically modified foods disappear from our grocery store shelves understanding where your food comes from and how its produced may help you make more informed decisions about what you put on your dinner plate [Music]",

I point this out because \"genetically modified\" has become a loaded term that is misused to describe recombinant DNA biotechnology, one of the most important technological advances in the 10,000-year history of agriculture. Throw in bogus, Hollywood-inspired terms like Franken Foods, Killer Tomatoes, and Terminator Seeds, and you have the makings of one of the most groundless anti-science campaigns in the history of anti-science campaigns.\n\nWe have been modifying the genetics of plants and animals since agriculture and the domestication of animals began. The anti-GMO activists counter, \"Nature never moves DNA from one species to another; therefore GMOs are 'unnatural'.\" Not so. Genes have been moving across species' boundaries since life began. Bacteria routinely carry fragments of DNA from one species to another, and that DNA is sometimes incorporated into the genes of the host species. \n\nThis random movement of genetic material has been one of the driving forces in the development of species. The human genome, for example, has 70 percent of its genes in common with the sea urchin. Why wouldn't we harness this naturally occurring phenomenon to improve the makeup of our food and fiber crops?\n\nToday 18 million farmers in 28 countries are growing genetically modified crops on 448 million acres, 12 percent of the world's farmland, or about the same area as all US cropland. It would be at least three times that if not for bans and restrictions in many countries -- bans and restrictions that are irrational, anti-science, and terribly harmful to the world's poor.\n\nEvery credible science, health, and nutrition organization in the world says the genetically modified food available today is safe -- without reservation.

            "transcript": " We are all genetically modified organisms,  Our 7 billion people and all living things on earth come from sexual reproduction. all 7 billion of us and every other creature on earth produced by sexual reproduction.  I pointed this out I point this out  Because \"GMO\" has become an overused word \"genetically modified\" has become a loaded term  Mistaken to describe recombinant DNA biotechnology that is misused to describe recombinant DNA biotechnology,  One of the most important technological advances in the 10,000-year history of agriculture.  Plus the fake Throw in bogus,  Hollywood-inspired terms such as Franken Food Killer Tomato and Sterilization Seed Hollywood-inspired terms like Franken Foods, Killer Tomatoes, and Terminator Seeds,  You got the makings of one of the most  One of the most ridiculous anti-science campaigns in the history of anti-scientific movements. groundless anti-science campaigns in the history of anti-science campaigns.  We have been modifying the genes of plants and animals We have been modifying the genetics of plants and animals  This started from agriculture and animal domestication. The agriculture and the domestication of animals began.  Inverse genetic activists refute The anti-GMO activists counter,  \"Nature never moves the DNA of one species to another species\" Nature never moves DNA from one species to another;  Therefore, genetic modification is \"unnatural\". Therefore GMOs are 'unnatural'.\"  Not so not so.  Genes have been moving across species' boundaries since life began.  The bacteria always carry fragmentary DNA from one species to another species, Bacteria routinely carry fragments of DNA from one species to another,  And the DNA is occasionally incorporated into the genes of the host and that DNA is sometimes incorporated into the genes of the host species.  This random movement of genetic material  One of the driving forces in the development of species.  For example, 70% of the genes in the human genome are the same as sea urchins. The human genome, for example, has 70 percent of its genes in common with the sea urchin.  Why don't we take advantage of this naturally occurring phenomenon? Why wouldn't we harness this naturally occurring phenomenon  To improve the composition of our food and fiber crops? To improve the makeup of our food and fiber crops?  Today 18 million farmers in 28 countries Today 18 million farmers in 28 countries  Planted 448 million acres of genetically modified crops are grown genetically modified crops on 448 million acres,  12% of the world's farmland, or about the same area as all US cropland.  This area will have tripled. It would be at least three times that  If not for bans and restrictions in many countries  These prohibitions and restrictions are irrational anti-science bans and restrictions that are irrational, anti-science,  And seriously hurt the world's poor and terribly harmful to the world's poor.  Every credible science, health, and nutrition organization in the world  It is said that the current GM foods on the market are safe - say the genetically modified food available today is safe -- without reservation.  Including the World Health Organization This includes the World Health Organization,  European Commission and the Society for Toxicology.  For example, how many people know How many people know, for example,  We make the Durum Wheat used to make most of our pasta  Contains DNA modified by exposure to high levels of gamma radiation? Had its DNA modified by exposing seeds to high-level gamma radiation?  And this does not require a label! And there is no labeling required!  But what about the seed companies that are said to be evil, such as Monsanto? But what about those supposedly evil seed companies like Monsanto?  Didn't they try to \"control the world food supply?\" Aren't they trying to \"control the world's food supply?\"  Let us first remember that these companies are not weapons manufacturers or drug trafficking groups First, let's remember that these companies are not weapons manufacturers or drug cartels;  They try to make better agricultural seeds they are trying to make better seeds for agriculture.  Second, the seed company does not decide which seeds to plant, the seed companies don't decide which seeds to plant;  The peasant is the person who made the decision.  The fact is that these companies have done a lot of good things. The fact is these companies have done massive good.  Millions of people eat nutritious food thanks to their innovative work Millions of people have nutritious food to eat thanks to their innovative work,  At the same time, the use of pesticides has been reduced. work that has also reduced the use of pesticides.  Recently the first comprehensive study of genetically modified crop performance  Announced some surprising numbers reported some interests numbers.  On average, average  GM crops increased yield by 22% and insecticide use by 37% GM crops increased yield by 22 percent, reduced pesticide use 37 percent,  Farmers\u2019 profits increased by 68% and increased farmer profits by 68 percent.  In addition, new varieties of GM crops  Providing nutritional benefits that are not present in the conventional varieties of crops.  The best known of these is the best known of these is Golden Rice.  A genetically modified rice variety differs from traditional rice a GM rice variety that, unlike conventional rice,  Its grain contains beta carotene has beta-carotene in the grain.  The human body converts beta carotene into vitamin A. The human body converts beta-carotene into vitamin A.  Vitamin A is insufficient for children to be blind and many will die. With enough vitamin A, children go blind, and many die  Poor countries in Africa and Asia are about two million people a year -- about 2 million every year in poor countries of Africa and Asia.  In fact, the lack of vitamin A is the biggest child killer in the world today, lack of vitamin A is the biggest killer of children in the world today.  Invented 15 years ago, 15 years ago,  Only golden rice may end all the vitamin A deficiency. Golden Rice alone has the potential to end all vitamin A deficiency.  However, the reverse gene movement is opposed to it because it is a transgenic. It is the anti-GMO movement is vehemently opposed to it just because it's a GMO.  As a result, no country has approved the commercial cultivation of golden rice. As a result no country has approved Golden Rice for commercial farming.  So when there is constant child blindness and death So, while children continue to go blind and die,  Reversing the genetic group but celebrating the victory of the anti-GMO crowd celebrates a victory.  However, should we be born with Monsanto? And we're supposed to be angry at Monsanto?  It's time to put an end to the debate over the safety of genetically modified crops and foods.  Today almost all beer, wine, cheese and yogurt, today nearly all of our beer, wine, cheese and yogurt  Made with GM yeast and strains made with GM yeast and culture.  Most of our livestock are genetically modified corn and soybeans, which are genetically modified corn and soybeans.  Most pre-processed foods contain genetically modified ingredients and most of our prepared foods contain GM ingredients.  Here is a simple solution Here's a simple solution:  People who want to believe there is something sinister or unhealthy about GM plants who are willing to believe that GM crops are evil or harmful to the body.  Should either buy food that is marked as non-GM, should either buy food that is labeled non-GM  Either buy more expensive so-called \"organic\" food or pay more for so-called \"organic\" food.  The rest of us, the ones who embrace science,  Can continue to live healthy and productive life can get on with healthy and productive lives.

            "transcript": " In the last several years we've seen some strange genetically modified organisms. Pigs that glow in the dark, chickens that grow without feathers, and even goats that produce spider silk proteins. But what really gets people riled up are genetically modified foods. The prospect of eating somebody's science project turns the stomach of those who aspire to eat so-called \"whole\" or \"natural\" foods. But what does \"genetically modified\" mean anyways? And how are those foods created? To answer those questions we need to go back in time about 10,000 years. That's when people first started domesticating animals and cultivating plants for food. By picking organisms with desirable traits and mating them together over and over again, people were able to mold species to meet their dietary needs. The classic example is corn, which started out as a tropical grass called Teosinthe with small, nearly inedible kernels. Over thousands of years, ancient farmers in Mexico transformed the grass into the delicious, starchy treat we like to eat today. We now know those ancient farmers were manipulating the DNA of the Teosinte plant. As few as five changes to it's genome, the long strands of DNA that encode for proteins create the dramatic differences we see between Teosinthe and corn. Scientists call this process \"artificial selection,\" and it's made all kinds of unappetising plants edible, from wheat to rice to almonds and bananas. What's different about modern is the speed and precision with which we can make changes. Now, instead of selectively breeding for traits, we can go directly to the DNA responsible, snip it out and transplant it into newly developing plants and animals. If these snippets come from the same species, scientists call the new organism \"cisgenic.\" \"Cis\" means \"the same.\" But if the DNA comes from a completely different plant or animal, \"transgenic.\" \"Trans\" means to cross. Those florescent pigs, they glow green because they contain a gene from a luminescent jellyfish. And in the last 20 years, we've begun to see the food equivalent. Corn that makes bacterial toxins poisonous to pests, tomatoes that make the antifreeze proteins from fish, and even cows that produce human milk. So you may be wondering if this overt kind of manipulation is safe. Well all of the GM foods currently on the market have been thoroughly tested. But the verdict is still out on some of the more exotic transgenic pairings. Personally, I'm waiting for a tomato that I can cut in the dark.

            "title": "How to Make a Genetically Modified Plant",
            "transcript": " Genetically modified plants are created by adding genes to specifically change a particular trait of the plant. Plants that have been genetically modified are sometimes referred to as transgenic plants. To make a genetically modified plant, you need the following components: - the DNA for the gene you want to express in the plant, including a promoter so the DNA is turned into the protein product; - a way to tell which plants contain the DNA modification; - a way to get the DNA into the plant; - and of course, a plant. The first item needed to make is a piece of DNA that encodes the desired trait. These genes can come from the same species or other species, or can be modifications of existing genes. Genetic modifications can improve a wide variety of plant features. Papaya Ringspot Virus almost wiped out papayas in Hawaii, but the expression of a ringspot protein gives Sunspot papayas resistance to the virus, much like an immunization. Bt products give corn and cotton resistance to borers and boll worms, insects that drill holes in the plant and kill it. Golden Rice was engineered to prevent blindness caused by vitamin A deficiency. Other modifications make the plan herbicide resistant, so a farmer can tend to a much larger acreage by spraying herbicides instead of plowing or manual weeding. There are also genetic modifications to facilitate farming under harsh conditions, like drought or salinity. Finally, some genetic modifications modify the properties of the plant itself, such as increasing the size or decreasing the growing time of the plant, or changing qualities like browning when an apple is cut. In addition to the DNA that codes for the desired trait, a plant specific promoter sequence is required. The promoter acts as the start point for transcription. The promotor that is most commonly used in genetically modified plants is derived from Cauliflower Mosaic Virus, and is abbreviated CaMV35S. We are going to need a lot of DNA to make a transgenic plant. The easiest way to make a large number of copies of your target DNA is to use bacteria as a copy machine. To do this, the DNA must be in a circular form, and contain an origin of replication. This circular DNA that can be replicated is called a plasmid, and is often represented as a circle, with key features indicated with color blocks and arrows. So now we have the DNA the promoter so the trait will be transcribed into RNA, all in a plasmid that can be replicated in a bacterial cell. But how are we going to tell if the DNA is in the cell? The most common strategy is to add an antibiotic resistance gene to the plasmid. If the bacteria is grown on plates containing the antibiotic, only the cells that contain the plasmid will grow. Let's review the components we need We need the DNA that codes for the desired trait. Check. With a promotor so the sequence will be transcribed and translated. We need a way to select for cells that contain our DNA; a plasmid with an antibiotic resistance gene meets this requirement. Now all we need is a way to get the DNA into the plant. There are two different ways that are commonly used to get DNA into a plant. The first technique is a brute force method: a gene gun. Gene guns fire DNA coated gold particles at the plant cells, and hope that some of them end up in the right place. Let's look at how a gene gun works up close. The gold particle is coated with DNA that includes the promoter, the sequence for the desired trait, and a selection marker. The gold particles are fired at the plant with enough force to go through the cell wall and plasma membrane, and hopefully land in the nucleus. This strategy has the advantage of not needing extra DNA from the plasmid, but it is damaging to cells and hard to control. The DNA is randomly incorporated into the chromosomes through DNA repair mechanisms, but could alter the expression of necessary plant genes, or end up in the mitochondrial or chloroplast genome instead of the nuclear genome. Obviously, another approach would be beneficial. Like many sophisticated techniques in biology, nature provides the model system. Do you see the tumor growing on this tree? It is caused by a bacterial infection with Agrobacterium tumefaciens, often referred to as Agrobacterium or just Agro. The Agrobacterium transfers a segment of DNA from a plasmid into a plant cell, causing the plant cells to grow (thus causing the tumor) and produce a food product for Agrobacterium caused opines. Let's look more closely at the tumor inducing (or Ti) plasmid. This is a very large plasmid, containing almost 200 genes and over 200,000 base pairs. Like all plasmids, it contains an origin of replication, so that the plasmid can be copied. Like most bacteria, many of the genes are organized into operons, so that activation of one promoter triggers the transcription and translation of several gene products involved in the same process. There are a set of virulence genes required for infecting and transferring DNA There is a separate operon containing genes required to metabolize the opines the plant will make for food for the bacteria. A section of the plasmid contains the sequence of DNA that will be transferred to the plant. This segment is called the Transfer or T DNA, and is defined by a left border and a right border sequence. The Transfer DNA contains two main sections, one that contains the genes that trigger tumor formation and a section that contains the genes to make the opines to feed the Agrobacterium. The ends of the sequences to be transcribed in the plant are marked with nopthaline synthesis or NOS termination sequences. To use this plasmid to make transgenic plants, the sections that are harmful to the plant are removed and the genes to be transferred into the plants are added. The opine synthesis and breakdown genes are removed, as well as the tumor inducing genes. The gene for the trait as well as a plant promoter is added in its place. Most of the time a very strong promoter, such as the 35S Cauliflower Mosaic Virus Promoter, is used to ensure that the production of the desired gene is high. A second selectable marker is introduced with a bacterial promoter, to allow for selection of Agrobacterium that contain the Ti plasmid. The virulence genes remain as they are necessary to transfer the T DNA from the Agrobacterium The transfer of the Ti plasmid from the Agrobacterium involves the expression of a number of genes in the Agrobacterium cell. Plant cells release a variety of small molecules. When one of these small molecules is detected by the Agrobacterium, it triggers the expression of a transcription factor that initiates the transcription of the virulence genes on the Ti plasmids. One of these gene products leads to the production of the T DNA sequence, which then moves through another virulence protein into the plant cell. Like the gene gun method, the T DNA is randomly incorporated into the chromosomal DNA, but there is much less damage to the cell, and no chance of incorporation into the chloroplast or mitochondrial DNA. So now we have the DNA for our desired trait, a selection method, and the choice of two different ways Once the DNA is successfully integrated into the plant genome, the plant is described as transformed. But how do you grow a transgenic plant from the few cells that incorporated the new DNA? Under sterile conditions, the plant cells are grown on media that contains both the antibiotic for selection and plant hormones. The antibiotic ensures that only cells that were transformed will grow, and the plant hormones allow for the generation of an entire plant from just a few plant cells. After the plant has generated both the root and shoot portions of the plant, it can be transferred to regular soil, and the new properties of the plant can be tested. So today we have seen that to make a transgenic plant, first the DNA sequence for a particular trait must be identified, and a promoter sequence added to ensure the transcription of the DNA into RNA once it is in the plant. This sequence is integrated into a plasmid containing a selectable marker such as an antibiotic resistance gene. and the selectable marker are transferred into a plant cell with either a gene gun or Agrobacterium mediated transformation, and then an entire plant is regenerated using sterile culture conditions with antibiotic selection and plant hormones.",

But even though that data shows GMO food has been scientifically proven to have no more negative effects on humans than non-GMO food, GMO food has been shown to be more nutritious with higher crop yields, which is news to co-host Chuck Nice. Bill says there are issues with GMOs, though, like the increasing use of monoculture farming, which leads to a loss of diversity across multiple vectors, and the impact and increased stress on pollinators that monoculture can lead to.

            "transcript": "  this is Startalk let's take a query let's go to the queries this is cory Garst coming to us from Google+ what kind of research has been done to show what effects GMOs do or do not have on humans well this is exactly the point this is Thank You Cory is that a that is Cory gharst from glasses from out there so what they we it has done is that is the one thing you can test is the effects of food I mean this one straightforward thing you can test that's that's not that different from twenty years ago you feed the food to your good friends the lab rats okay yeah and you and the mice and you say what do you think right so Steve that's the mouse's name Steve Henrietta right as long as it's not Mickey you're fine uh I think Mickey's really hard it's a hard lab rat to have to make well to kill would be manually hard right yeah well for some so the thing is there's no the genetically modified food has no effect on us I mean that is to say there's no difference between it and organically raised food this is scientifically provable ok certainly provable to my satisfaction and that's like the most straightforward thing about it is to see if it still is nutritious and Steve see if it has any allergy effect and it absolutely does not in fact in general all of these foods are more nutritious there are bigger is the first time I've ever heard that assertion well just in general I mean you get more soybean per hectare per acre like that you get more corn per acre per hectare you get bigger kernels of corn so from a voluminous standpoint I'm not just said if you're gonna if the if the bushel of corn ways so many kilos are pounds how much of that is nutritious corn and how much of that is cob unedible inedible ok that's a very good play yes you get a lot more you get a lot more kernel than cob yeah and just in that one example the famous example then the other thing that's happened with genetically modified foods and this maybe in the in the future queries the other thing that's happened is it's led to the success of this technology of allowing you to put glyphosate on fields and then plant things like crazy is people have raised enormous tracts of land in a single crop because it's easier gotcha and this is so-called monoculture and this has had two things first of all you you lose diversity in your farming and which leads to a loss of diversity in the microbes that support plants and a loss of diversity in the the the rate at which different pollinate able flowers appear this is to say okay if all the soybean plants come to go to flower at the same time the bees have to work that whole deal right they can't go from this plant to that plant to this plant you'll notice the cherry blossoms show up first right and that's their trick right so the bees and everybody they show up and they're like hey you know what cherry blossoms can I say do oh yes you do what they're doing the way you know Burnet bees that's right we know when the John cools show up then the daffodils and there's a sequence that has come-to by the way clearly the horrors of the plant world the daffodils but I'm just saying it's just on your mind just on your mind consenting adult it's all good harvestable plants right no so this has led to monoculture but I go along with the idea I mean I know I claim that the success of genetic modification with respect to glyphosate herbicide does not necessarily mean you plant a monoculture and stress out be colonies that's you you could that's not the cause and effect that's so funny when you say that I just hear Jerry Seinfeld going what are we gonna do there's so many flowers all at once that was a terrible Jerry sign it was also my understanding that was you doing Jerry Seinfeld bee bee bee yes a female bee yes exactly yeah so I brought by the way all the bees you see girls they're all females I seldom see because they kick the drones out as soon as they're finished mating with the Queen and it's just like they go straight Beyonce to the left to the left all your stuff in a box to the left get out awful I'll keep that in mind should I become a drone be a drone be a true but phenomenally the way you started it sounds like good work if you can get it yeah it does in a way so there's no difference in allergic reaction and and health concerns with respect to genetically modified foods worth compared with organic or non-genetically modified food we know that because the research has been done on mice oh well on mice and people I'm people it's been going on for almost 25 years fantastic and nobody gets sick from it in fact people are in general they get more food from a given hectare or acre of land and the strange thing that was pointed out to me and I did some research well over 90% of the world's farmers are small farmers right and they all use Roundup Ready crops or genetically modified crops because they're just so much more productive okay so as I say about glyphosate and I'm not an expert on roundup this is my thing but I've done some research there's two things that happen when roundup was introduced first of all everybody was afraid of it because it does kill every green plant was that something to be afraid of then the second thing is everybody started using it because it works so well this is the the troubling bifurcated effect hey this is scary as hell I know what we should all use it well that's happened okay all right hey Cory that was a great question and and a great answer by mr. Bill Nye all right I love you chuck this is",

[ CHANTING ] &gt;&gt; 2 MILLION PEOPLE IN 436 CITIES THEIR PROGRESS 100% FOCUSED ON GENETICALLY MODIFIED PRODUCTS, PLANTS, BACTERIA, AND ANIMALS WHOSE GENETIC MAKEUP HAS BEEN SCIENTIFICALLY ALTERED. THAT IS HOW ORGANIZERS LABELED THE MARCH AGAINST MONDAY SANTOS MARCH THAT TOOK PLACE THIS WEEKEND. SOME OPPONENTS OF THE GMOs WANT THEM BANNED. OTHERS SAY FOODS WHOSE DNA HAS BEEN CHANGED NEED AT LEAST TO BE LABELED. MONSANTO IS A LEADING PRODUCER OF GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEEDS AND HERBICIDES. IN THE LAST QUARTER ALON MONSANTO SOLD SEED MUCH OF IT MODIFIED WORTH MORE THAN $4 BILLION. IT'S A BUSINESS THE COMPANY SAYS THAT IS HELPING TO FEED THE PLANET. &gt;&gt; IT'S A VISION THAT STRIVES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF A RAPIDLY GROWING POPULATION. &gt;&gt; BUT THE PROTESTERS WANT TO KNOW JUST HOW THEIR FOOD IS BEING REENGINEERED. SOME OF THE OUTRAGE WAS SPARKED BY THESE SHOCKING PHOTOS SHOWING MASSIVE TUMORS THAT DEVELOPED ON THESE RATS AFTER THEY ATE GENETICALLY MODIFIED CORN OVER THEIR LIFE TIMES. BUT THAT STUDY BY RESEARCHERS AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CANNES IN FRANCE HAS BEEN CRITICIZED BY MANY IN THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY AND BY THE EUROPEAN FOOD SAFETY AUTHORITY WHO SAY IT IS SIMPLY NOT UP TO SCIENTIFIC STANDARDS. EVEN SO, THE DISTURBING TUMOR PHOTOS DID LEAD MANY TO QUESTION THEIR OWN STANDARDS ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY WE'RE ALL EATING. ONE QUESTION, HOW CAN YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE EATING GENETICALLY MODIFIED FOODS AND FEEDING IT TO YOUR FAMILY? WELL, YOU CAN'T. THAT'S THE ISSUE. &gt;&gt; I RECEIVED OVER 2200 LETTERS ON THIS TOPIC. &gt;&gt; LAST WEEK SENATORS DEBATED WHETHER STATES COULD REQUIRE FOOD LABELING FOR PRODUCTS WITH GENETICALLY ENGINEERED INGREDIENTS. &gt;&gt; THE CONCEPT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT TODAY IS A FAIRLY COMMON SENSE AND NONRADICAL IDEA. &gt;&gt; THE LEGISLATION INTRODUCED BY INDEPENDENT VERMONT SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS FAILED. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU TAKE ON VERY POWERFUL BIOTECH COMPANIES LIKE MONSANTO AND LARGE FOOD CORPORATIONS WHO IN MANY WAYS PREFER THAT PEOPLE NOT KNOW WHAT IS IN THE FOOD THAT THEY PRODUCE THEY ARE VERY POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; THIS COMES ON THE HEELS OF WHAT CRITICS CALL THE MONDAY SANTOS PROTECTION ACT, LEGISLATION PASSED BY CONGRESS AND SIGNED BY THE PRESIDENT EARLIER THIS YEAR, A BILL THAT ALLOWS GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS APPROVED BY THE AGRICULTURE DEPARTMENT TO BE GROWN EVEN IF THERE IS ACTION IN THE COURTS DECLARING THEM TO BE DANGEROUS. &gt;&gt; YOU HAVE DEREGULATED THE GMO INDUSTRY FROM OVERSIGHT WHICH IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS ABOUT. YOU SHOULD NOT BE PUTTING RIDERS THAT PEOPLE AREN'T FAMILIAR WITH IN A MAJOR PIECE OF LEGISLATION. &gt;&gt; ON ITS WEBSITE MONSANTO STATES, QUOTE, PLANT BIOTECHNOLOGY HAS BEEN IN USE FOR OVER 15 YEARS WITHOUT DOCUMENTED EVIDENCE OF ADVERSE EFFECTS ON HUMAN OR ANIMAL HEALTH OR THE ENVIRONMENT. LEGISLATORS WHO SIDED WITH MONSANTO SAY THE COMPANY IS IMPROVING ON NATURE. &gt;&gt; I THINK IT WOULD BE MORE ACCURATELY CALLED A MODERN SCIENCE TO FEED A VERY TROUBLED AND HUNGRY WORLD. &gt;&gt; LAW OR NO LAW GROCERY GIANT WHOLE FOODS SAYS",

            "description": "English/Nat\r\n\r\nA government-appointed panel in the U-S has determined that genetically-modified foods now on the market are safe.\r\n\r\nBut some question the objectivity of the committee's report, which was released on Wednesday.\r\n\r\nAs researchers released their findings to the press inside the National Academy of Sciences, protesters made their voices heard outside the building.\r\n\r\nThe government's review and monitoring of crops that are genetically modified to be resistant to pests should be tightened to ensure the crops' safety to humans.\r\n\r\nThat word from a panel of U-S scientists appointed by the government to study the safety of G-M foods to humans and the environment.\r\n\r\nGenetic engineering involves splicing one or more genes from one organism into a plant to give it specific traits.\r\n\r\nThe panel's chairman believes the testing and regulation of such foods should be rigorous in order to assure wider appeal.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\"Public acceptance of these foods ultimately depends on the credibility of the testing of the regulatory process and we believe these must be as rigorous as possible and based on the soundest of science. That said, I must also emphasize that the committee is not aware of any evidence suggesting that foods on the market today are unsafe to eat as a result of genetic modification.\"\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Perry Adkisson, Texas A&M Professor\r\n\r\nProtesters outside the National Academy of Sciences on Wednesday described the committee's report as rife with conflicts of interests.\r\n\r\nOne Congressman cited an example of a scientist who assisted in the report leaving to work in the genetically modified food industry.\r\n\r\nConflicts of interest were so rampant that he suggested the study be abandoned.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\"The American public wants answers about the health, safety and environmental issues of genetically engineered food. But this report, the credibility of which is impaired by conflicts of interest, will only create more confusion and more controversy. For these reasons, I have requested that the NAS abandon the study.\"\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Representative Dennis Kucinich, Democrat-Ohio\r\n\r\nAdkisson was scornful of any attack on the reports impartiality, saying the authors based their conclusions on science alone.\r\n\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\r\n\"Considering the current public debate over genetically modified organisms, we are not surprised that there would be intense scrutiny of our committee's composition. Clearly this issue is a contentious one, with extraordinarily strong feelings on all sides. Nevertheless, our committee came together in a very productive way and we worked very hard to examine the science and to draw conclusions and recommendations based on the science.\"\r\nSUPER CAPTION: Perry Adkisson, Texas A&M Professor\r\n\r\nNevertheless, Wednesday's report is certainly not the last word in the debate over G-M foods.\r\n\r\nG-M crops have met consumer resistance in Asia and in Europe - in Britain it's derided as \"Frankenfood.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/20fa361421de499911b03f6b3f17dc48 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

            "transcript": " English CC by Charles Baaluyot Rebecca: After one of the largest restaurant chains in America, decided to ban genetically modified organisms from its menu in 2015, the hot topic of GMOs is back on the world stage. Welcome to 'WatchMojo News', the weekly series were we breakdown new stories that might be on your radar. In this installment, we're counting down 10 crucial facts you should know about genetically modified foods. The acronym 'G.M.O.' stands for 'genetically modified organisms', whereby a microorganism, plant or animal, has been genetically altered using advanced genetic engineering techniques, such as genome editing. Humankind has been using a form of genetic modification, since 12,000 B.C., in the form of selective breeding and the domestication of plants and animals. By cultivating organisms with certain desired traits, generation after generation of farmers, was able to breed selectively superior products. Furthermore, in the 20th century, scientists started using bacteria, or microscopic gold particles to insert new genetic material into foods. The flavor savor, a genetically modified tomato, was the first genetically modified food item approved for humans to eat. Given a license from the 'United States Food and Drug Administration' in 1994, the tomato was more resistant to rotting and ripened slowly. Its production eventually ceased in 1997, with research revealing... That the public's opinion towards genetically engineered crops changed during the years. The dawn of the genetically modified organism, followed the creation of the first recombinant DNA molecules by American biochemist, Paul Berg in 1972. Recombinant DNA, is created by combining one piece of DNA with another, creating a modified sequence that would not otherwise occur in nature. In order to genetically scientists use a variety of mechanisms including mutation, insertion, or the deletion of genes within the organism. Furthermore, the process by which this can occur, is by the transformation of the genetic material of the organism, or by the editing of the genome, by using artificially engineered nucleuses. In 1992, China became the first country to formally commercialize transgenics, with the launch of a virus resistant tobacco plant. There are six pesticide and GMO corporations, that own and control the world seeds, pesticides, and biotechnology industries. These big 6 are: BASF, Bayer, DuPont, Dow Chemical Company, Monsanto and Syngenta. Out of these half a dozen corporations, Monsanto became the world's largest conventional seed company in 2005. Founded in 1901 in St. Louis, Missouri by John Francis Queeny, Monsanto evolved from selling food additives like artificial sweeteners, to being a leader in the evolution of agriculture, and an ever-present government agency lobbyists. And with nearly 15 billion dollars in annual revenue, Monsanto is also leading leading producer of genetically modified crop seeds and herbicides. Following the approval of the commercial growth of several genetically modified crops by the U.S. in 1996. The amount of surface area attributed to these crops has increased 100 (one hundred) fold. The most prevalent types of GM crops grown in the United States, are corn, soybean, cotton, canola, papaya, sugar beets, and alfalfa. These crops are used in a variety of different ways, for example, cotton is used not only to yield cotton, but also cotton seed, which is used as a cooking oil, in margarine, shortening, and to fried foods. Furthermore, according to the 'Center for Food Safety', 3/4 (three-quarters) of all processed foods contain genetically modified ingredients, such as crackers, cookies, chips, etc.. As of 2015, over 90% (ninety percent) of all soybean, cotton, and corn acreage in the United States is being used to grow genetically modified crops. The purpose of genetically modified organisms, is to create a distinct advantage, for the producer or the consumer, that would otherwise not occur in nature. These advantages can appear in the form of lower prices and bigger produce advantages, such as durability and nutritional value. GMO crop growers benefit from the seeds, as their crops have a higher resistance to pests, plant diseases, and herbicides, thereby allowing for a higher volume of crops. Consumers could soon profit from GMO's in a whole new way, as seed producers have begun selling products with health and taste benefits. Companies like Pioneer and Monsanto, are producing soybean oils that are free of trans fats, and enriched with Omega-3 fatty acids. Furthermore, you will soon be able to eat apples that won't go brown, and potatoes that won't bruise or go brown. As the 'Arctic apple' and 'J.R. Simplot companies Innate\u00ae potatoes', will soon be released on the market. The safety debates surrounding genetically modified organisms, is extremely polarizing, as scientists and activists, hardly disagree on the topic. In the United States, the 'Food and Drug Administration', has never safety tested genetically engineered food. They've decided, that it's up to the biotech producers to determine the safety of the product. On the other hand, large groups of activists collectively view GMOs, as nothing more than frankenfoods, potential to cause environmental and health problems. The implications, are that genetically modified organisms could cause allergic reactions in humans, and therefore must be tested prior to market release. That being said, according to the 'American Association for the Advancement of Science', crop improvement that uses genetically modifying techniques is safe. A major cause for concern for farmers, is the spread of altered genes from modified crops, to traditionally farmed crops through airborne pollen. This would directly affect them, as many countries worldwide, ban or highly regulate the import of GMO products. One featured benefit of genetically modified crops... Is that they are highly resistant to pests, and therefore do not need to be sprayed with pesticides as often. Unfortunately, this has led to an increase of secondary pests, thereby leading to an increase of insecticide use, negating the original benefit. Another argument against GMOs, is that the use of agro-chemicals, has an unintended impact on the environment and biodiversity. This argument is supported by a multitude of reports, which showed that the use or increased use of agro-chemicals, leads to a decline independent populations, such as milkweed and monarch butterflies. As it stands, there are a multitude of concerns regarding the environment, and the uncharted spread of genetically modified crops. There is widespread controversy surrounding the patent ownership and production of seeds. The genetically modified seed market is valued at nearly 15 billion ($15 B) dollars, making it an extremely profitable and valuable industry. One-way biotech giant, Monsanto controls its business is through its herbicide-resistant seeds. For example, there soybean seeds are resistant to the herbicide 'Roundup', a Monsanto product, making them highly valuable, as they lead to larger crops, and higher sales of Roundup. In addition, Monsanto typically requires farmers who purchase their products, to sign a contract, promising not to harvest the seeds from the resulting crop, ensuring continued business. As of 2007, the 10 biggest seed companies controlled over sixty-five (65%) percent of all seeds, by proprietary or intellectual property laws concerning the seeds. company leading the way is 'Whole Foods', an american food supermarket chain, which requires its providers to be GMO-free, or GMO labeled by 2018. In April 2015, the American fast-food chain Chipotle announced, that they would only use products from non-genetically modified organisms in their food. Chipotle is the first major restaurant chain to start identifying GMOs on their menu, as demand for GMO-free products continues to grow. That being said, product offerings will not be completely GMO-free as Chipotle will continue to sell soft drinks with corn sweeteners, and GMO grain-fed meat. Yet this is not limited to restaurants, because as of January 2015, member states of the European Union, can now decide to opt out of GMOs, and can now restrict or completely banned the production of GMOs within their country. This is in addition to the many which have an import or production ban on GMOs, such as Norway, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia. The European Union is among the toughest regions, as it not only requires the labeling of GMOs, but also the traceability of every step of the production and supply chain. This is in sharp contrast to the United States, which, as of November 2014, had only three states pass a law requiring food be labeled, 'GMO'. Though only Vermont's labeling law has actually been slated to go into effect, concrete date in 2016. According to Du Pont spokesperson, Jane Slusark, the American chemical giant believes, that labeling would not only be costly, but also confusing to the consumer. Chemical, agricultural, and large food companies have spent over $100 million dollars, on anti-GMO labeling campaigns in a handful of American states, where there were ballot initiatives on GMO labeling. As of 2013, 64 nations had enacted mandatory labeling laws on genetically modified food. Yet, as of May 2015, States and Canada have no such laws. Finally, as world hunger increases, only time will tell what the effect GMOs have on humans and the environment. Did these facts surprise you?

            "transcript": "  why do we need GMOs at all this is Startalk and I'm your host Neil deGrasse Tyson your personal astrophysicist and I'm also the director of New York City's Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History and I've got with me my coach Chuck nice Chuck a baby I'm still tweeting it Chuck nice comic that's right love your stuff love your see in weird places and but the weird fun places all the time on TV yes it's great exactly they should just show up in place that's pretty much my whole career weird fun places on TV it's like a Where's Waldo it's like we're today so today I don't think we're talking about the science of GMOs and today we're featuring my interview with film director Scott Kennedy and he directed the documentary food evolution and just as a point of disclosure I let my voice to the film so I narrated the film I didn't write it I assist into some sentences just for clarity but it's his project and he found GMO scientist and and your voice lends a certain credence to the subject yours your well-known scientist and science as what's it when everyone knows your voice well when I when I read the scripts I okay he's trying to get the truth out there and that's all any scientist tries to do establish what is objectively true and share that wait a minute whether or not it agrees with any of your prior philosophies that's all I'm saying I heard what you guys were doing was trying to get that fat grant money so you could live it up and make it exactly all the people living in mansions from grant money my NSF yacht so a GMO of course is the abbreviation for genetically modified organisms and you know it's not an acronym just to make that clear okay decorative has to be pronounceable as a word right so NASA is an acronym GMO is just an abbreviation right because if you pronounced it so I I don't claim specific expertise and I'd have general knowledge we're not specific expertise and so anytime we're in that situation we bring in someone who's got the expertise so that's so joining us by video called today is our guest a plant geneticist pamela ronald Pamela welcome to the show thanks for having me yeah yeah so you studied rice genetics at UC Davis is that correct I do now I thought it UC Davis they just make wine there's a huge wine school there at UC Davis you're doing a lot of research you need to drink a little bit of wine now and then so so that's the relationship among the schools of study yeah and you're a co-author of a book tomorrow's table organic farming genetics and the future of food that's right it's a book I wrote with my husband who's an organic farmer okay alright Wow so you are you're a plant geneticist he's an organ you're like the Romeo and Juliet of biology it's pretty cool we're still alive though so why don't you start with basics here and just tell us what is a GMO and how do you how do you create them well as you said its abbreviation you know the term isn't really so useful for advancing discussions about sustainable agriculture and that's because the term seems to me means something different to everyone and the Food and Drug Administration has stated that it's scientifically meaningless and that's because everything we eat breakfast lunch and dinner has been genetically altered in some manner and so for an example some foods have been developed through a process of chemical or irradiation mutagenesis which introduce random changes in the genome some are developed through conventional breeding or hybridization and genetic engineering is a technique week to take a gene from any species and put it into a plan so you could take a gene from a virus for example and put it into a plant so so what you're saying is something I've known for a while but it's good to hear it just sort of out of the horse's mouth here that you you know we've been modifying organisms ever since the dawn of Agriculture right there there are no herds of wild milk cows wandering the countryside they we invented a cow for our purposes to get meat and to get milk and and we that we cultivate we usually cultivate but it's really you're genetically changing corn from whatever cavemen ate to these big ol sticks of corn that we now munch on so this is true for essentially every food in the grocery yeah that's correct and genetic engineering and uh another approach genome editing these are more modern tools but we've been spending about ten thousand years of history and there's been changes along the way Mendel discovered the genetic basis of inheritance farmers started mixing two species together through grafting there's me to genesis hybridization so there's many different types of techniques and genetic engineering has been around for 40 years and is one of the newer techniques so they're so they're distinguishing genetic engineering which happens in a laboratory from the genetic changes that were brought about through a crossbreeding and the history of this exercise going back to the dawn of Agriculture well that's partly true but a lot of crops that organic farmers and other farmers grow have been developed in the laboratory so it's not necessarily a laboratory step there's not really a scientific reason for excluding genetically engineered crops from organic agriculture but there's a historical reason why do we need GMOs at all I mean I know your answer but it's want to just hear it what is the data that we need so called GMOs but we need to advance sustainable agriculture and there are many important tools that we need and as I mentioned before we need ecolodge based farming practices but we also need seed that seed could be developed with many approaches but for particular there's some problems that have no real solution except genetic engineering we know some insecticides are very dangerous so there's the World Health Organization reports that 300,000 people die every year from overuse or misuse of insecticides mostly in less developed countries they don't have safety measures that they can take but what we do know is that every major scientific organization in the world including the National Academy of Sciences the European Food Safety Authority and many other organizations have concluded that the process of genetic engineering is no more risky than conventional breeding and in fact genetic engineering has been used for 40 years it's been used in cheese's in medicine and in crops and there hasn't been a single case of harm to human health or the environment so Scott Scott Kennedy okay as a documentary filmmaker I I think generally documentarians lean left politically left would you agree with that you think about it yeah for the most part and he makes a film that is not anti GMO so this is kind of whoa what's where's that what's what's he thinking if you are a left-leaning documentarian who puts out a a work that is not critical of GMOs then people are like another one's been bought expect Monsanto got to him too so I so I had to ask him so I've got I interviewed him just for this purpose and so I had to ask him what was he thinking as someone who generally leans left in his politics and in his thinking and definitely as a documentarian so let's check out what he said we wanted to make a film are so many reasons why we wanted to make this film one of the biggest ones was relieving anxiety right I've seen so many of my friends so many my neighbors so many parents and mothers that have their shoulders like this I know you can't see me on radio but they have their shoulders up again up in their ears about food and where they're getting their information from and they're freaked out so it's anxiety anxiety yeah and should we have that anxiety right that's the first question it's already about food should we have anxiety about food right and when we kept doing the research the overall science and data said we are living we could not be living in a safer time for our food more abundant food or nutritious food available to more people than we then then we were living in right now and that's not being communicated by some of the smartest people that have the ear of especially in a country like the United States have the ear of the media there's fear all over the place chemicals and pesticides and all of these things are some of those things in the food system absolutely but risk assessment so that was one of the biggest motivations can I can we make a film that talks about food and science and safety and sustainability looking towards 9 billion people screaming at us by 2050 are we gonna make our food system more sustainable and do it in a way that doesn't just give a Hall Pass to big food and big government and these other vague terms that are out there that have data that exists to say we need to be concerned about those things big profits and big greed can lead to problems does that mean the world is upside down and I shouldn't trust anybody and I shouldn't trust food and I shouldn't trust my government no that's what we found so so Pamela how do we what's our evidence that a genetically modified food stuff is is safe because that's been a big issue out there a big concern and can we genetically modify food to lower anxiety kill two birds with one stone on their way man what we're at it why don't we get to it yeah yeah well every crop must be looked at on a case-by-case basis whether it's genetically engineered or developed through mutagenesis but what health or the environment and I think it's important to remember that these are the same organizations that most of us trust when it comes to the safety of vaccines or the effects of a clinic changing climate oh well in that case you're screwed well you can see it's very politicized so the scientific consensus is very clear it doesn't matter if you live in France or if you live in the United States the scientific community has reached a consensus but you see that these different these are three hot topics vaccines climate chains and so-called GMOs that have been extremely politicized making it very very difficult for consumers to really access accurate science-based information so so this distrust this this anxiety I always wondered like where it came from did do scientists need better marketing people I mean III don't know so I asked Scott I asked him where does he think this anxiety comes from when normally these are people that would otherwise trust scientists and whatever is the consensus of observations and experiments so we chatted about that check it out we came to call it we're living in an age of distrust and in my simpleton historian way I go back to Watergate as being the beginning of modern distrust right we have distrusted each other since caveman days and we can get into it but the effect that Watergate had to to Effects of Watergate had was seeing the ruthlessness of money and power in politics how far they can go we like oh we didn't trust some politicians a little bit but this is another level the second one which is very interesting with the internet is who saved us from what could have been the outcome of Watergate would were in Bernstein two journalists now cut to 2016 and the journalists are on the internet some of them brilliant and doing hard work and getting us a piece of information that the New York Times could never get to and then there's a bunch of quacks that think they're Woodward and Bernstein trying to save the world and point out corruption it's like they want to find the next controversy so they can go see the rapture have to find a country where you have to find it whether or not it's there that's right interesting analysis and it and and that bad anxiety I'm surprised a lot of these people just even go outside you know if you follow through you know if you follow through on the level anxiety they have I'm like so why aren't you under your bed right now I could I would be if I believe what you believe you be in your closet I don't I don't get it you know the unknown unknowns and all of this I'm like okay there are tons of things that we don't know about and there but thankfully there are many many more things that we do have good information about and we do know that if you're choosing to eat a traditionally produced vegetable called they would call that big egg first an organically produced vegetable which is more important and my friend and dr. John Schwartzberg at the Berkeley wellness letter somebody tried to communicate good science said it's much more important to eat the vegetable than determine between those two vegetables right eat the vegetable eat the frozen vegetable eat the canvas your vegetables sorry he's got some buttons there okay Pamela do we just we do we just eat our vegetables let's solve all the problems it'll solve a lot of problems it's not always easy to do I have a 16 year old daughter getting her eat vegetables it's not so easy and then there's places in much of the world where children don't have access to vegetables so but if you can eat your fruits and vegetables that's that's important but still you know I know because of my husband that farming is challenging whether it's a big farm or a small farm farmers face a lot of challenges and they need the best tools available so all farmers whether you're an organic farmer or a large conventional farmer you need to have access to genetically improve crop varieties as well as good farming practices and government policies is it possible to be an organic farmer of genetically modified foods so according to the National Organic Program standards if you want to be certified organic you cannot grow genetically engineered crops however you can grow crops that have been developed through mutagenesis or hybridization you can buy your seat for Monsanto you could do pretty much everything in terms of planting genetically improved seeds except you cannot for example plant the genetically engineered papaya that I know you're going to talk about on your show and be certified organic there's a serious insect that can destroy an entire egg plant crop in Bangladesh if it's not controlled and eggplant is the most important vegetable in Bangladesh so to control this disease farmers spray chemical insecticides two to three times a week and but we know some insecticides safety measures that they can take so bangladeshi and Cornell scientists decided to try to control this insect using a genetic approach that builds on an organic farming strategy so organic farmers will spray a pesticide called BT on crops to control various types of insect infections and they use it because it's not harmful to humans or wildlife or fish and in fact it's less toxic than than table salt but the problem is in Bangladesh it's very difficult to get this insecticide it's expensive and it doesn't prevent the insect from getting inside the plant so what the Bangladeshi and Cornell scientists did was they took that gene from the bacteria and they entered it directly into the eggplant and it's been really very effective in the last three years farmers that are growing this eggplant can reduce their insecticides dramatically often down to zero and they could self the seed and replant it the next season is it's a public domain seed you've been listening to Startalk and i've been your host Neil deGrasse Tyson your personal astrophysicist Chuck nice as always thanks for doing this and thanks to to Pamela Ronald for being on the show and as always I bid you to keep looking up [Music]",

            "transcript": "  &gt;&gt; Sreenivasan: TONIGHT, WE LAUNCH A PBS NEWSHOUR WEEKEND SPECIAL SERIES, \"THE FUTURE OF FOOD.\" OVER THE COMING MONTHS, WE'LL FOCUS ON STORIES AROUND THE WORLD WHERE EFFORTS TO FIGHT FOOD SCARCITY AND WASTE ARE ONGOING. HERE'S AUTHOR MARK BITTMAN TO INTRODUCE OUR FIRST STORY IN THE SERIES ON THE DEBATE OVER GENETICALLY-MODIFIED SALMON. &gt;&gt; Bittman: FISH IS AN IMPORTANT PROTEIN SOURCE FOR MANY PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD, AND WE'RE EATING MORE OF IT THAN EVER BEFORE. AND WITH ONE-THIRD OF THE WORLD'S STOCKS OVERFISHED, AQUACULTURE HAS TAKEN OFF, TRIPLING PRODUCTION IN THE LAST 20 YEARS. YET TO DATE, FISH FARMING HAS STRUGGLED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS JUST LIKE LAND-BASED FARMING HAS. ONE SMALL COMPANY IS PRODUCING A GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED SALMON IT SAYS COULD HELP SOLVE SOME OF THESE PROBLEMS AND HELP MEET THE WORLD'S DEMAND. OTHERS SAY IT'S A DANGEROUS STEP IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. MEGAN THOMPSON HAS MORE. THIS REPORT IS SUPPORTED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE PULITZER CENTER. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IF YOU FLY TO THE TINY PROVINCE OF PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND ON CANADA'S EASTERN COAST, THEN DRIVE ABOUT AN HOUR EAST OUT OF THE CAPITAL CITY, YOU'LL FINALLY COME TO A SMALL, UNMARKED BUILDING GUARDED BY A CHAIN-LINK FENCE. THERE'S NOTHING SPECIAL ABOUT IT OUTSIDE, BUT INSIDE IS ANOTHER STORY. THESE TANKS CONTAIN THE ONLY GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED ANIMAL IN THE WORLD THAT'S BEEN DEEMED SAFE TO EAT: ATLANTIC SALMON MODIFIED TO GROW FASTER. &gt;&gt; USING NEW TECHNOLOGY IS AN INTELLIGENT WAY TO MEET THE GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY NEEDS OF THE FUTURE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: RON STOTISH IS CHIEF TECHNOLOGY OFFICER OF AQUABOUNTY, THE COMPANY PRODUCING THE GENETICALLY- ENGINEERED, OR \"G.E.,\" SALMON. &gt;&gt; WE'RE GOING TO RUN OUT OF LAND AND RUN OUT OF WATER TO DO WHAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO UNLESS WE FIND A BETTER WAY TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; THEY KNOW IT'S FEEDING TIME. YEAH, THEY'RE PRETTY HAPPY. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL OPERATION MAKING BIG WAVES-- 50 EMPLOYEES AT THREE FACILITIES IN CANADA AND THE U.S., BREEDING, HATCHING AND GROWING THE SALMON TRADEMARKED \"AQUADVANTAGE.\" THEY HOPE TO HAVE IT ON THE AMERICAN MARKET NEXT YEAR. IT WILL BE THE FINAL STEP IN A LONG PROCESS THAT BEGAN IN ANOTHER PART OF CANADA. THE STORY OF GENETICALLY- ENGINEERED SALMON BEGAN NEARLY THREE DECADES AGO HERE IN NEWFOUNDLAND, CANADA, AT MEMORIAL UNIVERSITY'S OCEAN SCIENCES CENTER, ONE OF THE WORLD'S LEADING MARINE RESEARCH LABS. IN THE 1980s, PHYSIOLOGIST GARTH FLETCHER AND HIS COLLEAGUES STARTED READING ABOUT THE FIRST WORK BEING DONE TO CREATE A GENETICALLY-MODIFIED MOUSE. &gt;&gt; AND WE SAID, \"WELL, IF THEY CAN DO THAT IN MICE, MAYBE WE CAN DO THAT IN FISH.\" &gt;&gt; Reporter: FLETCHER CAME UP WITH THE IDEA OF ALTERING ATLANTIC SALMON D.N.A. TO GET THE FISH TO GROW MORE QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BEHIND EVERY PRODUCTION SYSTEM IS AN ACCOUNTANT THAT SAYS, \"ARE WE MAKING ANY MONEY,\" YOU KNOW, \"CAN WE PRODUCE THE FISH FASTER, CAN WE TURN,\" YOU KNOW, \"TURN THE INVENTORY OVER,\" TYPE IDEA. &gt;&gt; Reporter: A SALMON'S GROWTH HORMONES ARE MORE ACTIVE DURING CERTAIN TIMES OF THE YEAR. FLETCHER THOUGHT, WHAT IF HE COULD GET THE HORMONES TO STAY ACTIVE ALL THE TIME? HE TOOK D.N.A. FROM A FISH CALLED AN OCEAN POUT, WHICH PRODUCES A SPECIAL PROTEIN ALL YEAR LONG THAT HELPS IT SURVIVE IN FRIGID WATERS. FLETCHER TOOK THE D.N.A. THAT KEEPS THOSE PROTEINS TURNED ON AND RUNNING, AND CONNECTED IT TO A SALMON GROWTH HORMONE GENE WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF KEEPING THE GROWTH HORMONE ON. &gt;&gt; NOW, IT'S FREE TO RUN SUMMER AND WINTER IF YOU WISH, ALL YEAR 'ROUND. &gt;&gt; Reporter: FLETCHER INSERTED THE GENE INTO HIS SALMON EGGS AND WAITED TO SEE WHAT WOULD HAPPEN. &gt;&gt; SO, IN THE SPRING OF 1990, WE SAW SOME BIG ONES. SO, WE SAID, \"OOH, MAYBE IT'S THAT.\" &gt;&gt; Reporter: SO, YOU COULD SEE THAT THESE FISH WERE BIGGER? &gt;&gt; YEAH, MUCH BIGGER THAN THE OTHER ONES. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AS SCIENTISTS SEEING THAT WHAT YOU'RE DOING IS WORKING, WHAT DOES THAT FEEL LIKE? &gt;&gt; WELL, WE WERE JUST AMAZED, RIGHT? &gt;&gt; Reporter: FLETCHER PATENTED HIS TECHNOLOGY AND STARTED A COMPANY, WHICH EVENTUALLY BECAME AQUABOUNTY. HIS INVENTION IS STILL THE CENTER OF ITS WORK, A THAT GROWS TWICE AS FAST AS REGULAR SALMON WHILE ACTUALLY CONSUMING LESS FEED. THE DIFFERENCE IS SIGNIFICANT; THESE FISH ARE BOTH ABOUT TWO YEARS OLD. IT'S REALLY HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THESE SALMON ARE THE SAME AGE, AND THERE'S SUCH A HUGE SIZE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM. &gt;&gt; THIS FISH IS FIVE KILOS, READY FOR MARKET. THAT FISH IS A LONG WAYS FROM &gt;&gt; Reporter: IN THE UNITED STATES, THE MAJORITY OF THE SALMON CONSUMED IS ATLANTIC SALMON, BUT ALMOST ALL OF IT IS IMPORTED FROM OCEAN FARMS IN NORWAY, CHILE AND CANADA. THAT'S BECAUSE, IN THE U.S., WILD ATLANTIC SALMON IS ENDANGERED, SO CATCHING IT IS ILLEGAL. OCEAN FARMING IS ONLY PERMITTED IN A FEW PLACES, AND, UNTIL RECENTLY, THERE WASN'T MUCH INTEREST IN EXPENSIVE, LAND-BASED PRODUCTION LIKE AQUABOUNTY'S. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A FISH THAT GROWS A LITTLE FASTER, SUCH AS AN AQUADVANTAGE THAT REACHES MARKET WEIGHT IN HALF THE TIME, YOU CAN PRODUCE THOSE FISH ALMOST ANYWHERE BECAUSE YOU CAN GROW THEM IN A LAND-BASED AQUACULTURE FACILITY CLOSER TO CONSUMERS. SO, YOU CAN REDUCE THE TRANSPORTATION COST. YOU CAN REDUCE THE CARBON FOOTPRINT ASSOCIATED WITH TRANSPORTATION. SO, THIS... THIS OPENS UP A WHOLE NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR GLOBAL SALMON PRODUCTION. &gt;&gt; Reporter: RON STOTISH TALKS OF PRODUCING ATLANTIC SALMON IN PLACES IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE BEFORE-- LIKE INDIANA, WHERE AQUABOUNTY HAS SET UP ITS FIRST AMERICAN FACILITY. &gt;&gt; AND THIS IS A... A HOT SMOKED SALMON PREPARATION FROM A ROUGHLY FIVE-KILO AQUADVANTAGE &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE GAVE ME A TASTE OF THE PRODUCT. IT'S DELICIOUS. &gt;&gt; ( LAUGHS ) IT'S VERY GOOD. &gt;&gt; Reporter: I MEAN, I THINK SOME PEOPLE MIGHT THINK THAT THIS WOULD TASTE SOMEHOW DIFFERENT THAN NON-GENETICALLY- MODIFIED SALMON, BUT IT TASTES EXACTLY THE SAME. &gt;&gt; IT'S EXACTLY THE SAME. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AQUABOUNTY FIRST APPLIED FOR APPROVAL FROM THE U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION IN 1995. WHILE IT'S BEEN REGULATING GENETICALLY-MODIFIED PLANTS FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS, THE F.D.A. HAD NEVER APPROVED A GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED ANIMAL AS FOOD BEFORE, AND SO IT TOOK THEM TWO DECADES TO MAKE A DECISION. AND THERE WAS STIFF OPPOSITION; PROTESTERS SENT NEARLY TWO MILLION COMMENTS TO THE F.D.A. AND NEARLY 80 RETAILERS VOWED NOT TO SELL IT. DESPITE THE CONCERNS, IN 2015, THE F.D.A. APPROVED AQUADVANTAGE SALMON, SAYING THE PRODUCT IS \"SAFE TO EAT,\" \"HAS NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT,\" AND IT FOUND \"NO BIOLOGICALLY RELEVANT DIFFERENCES\" BETWEEN G.E. SALMON AND OTHER FARM-RAISED SALMON. THE NEXT YEAR, THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT GAVE THE SALMON ITS STAMP OF APPROVAL, AND AQUABOUNTY HIT THE MARKET THERE FIRST, SINCE SELLING A MODEST 20,000 POUNDS OF ITS PRODUCT. CANADIAN OPPONENTS REMAIN OUTRAGED. &gt;&gt; DO WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO MANIPULATE THE D.N.A. OF ANOTHER LIVING BEING? AND... AND I DON'T AGREE THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT HUMANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SHARON LABCHUK, OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP EARTH ACTION, HAS HELPED LEAD THE FIGHT AGAINST G.E. SALMON IN CANADA FOR DECADES. SHE SAYS NO ONE CAN PREDICT WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN PEOPLE START EATING THE FISH OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. &gt;&gt; WE'VE HAD, SAY, 20 YEARS OR SO EXPERIENCE IN CANADA OF GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED PLANT FOODS, AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHAT ARE THE HEALTH EFFECTS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: SO FAR, AQUABOUNTY HAS SOLD ITS SALMON TO DISTRIBUTORS, AND THE COMPANY SAYS IT DOESN'T KNOW WHERE IT ENDED UP AFTER THAT. THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT RESTAURANTS OR FOOD SERVICES LABEL G.E. SALMON, AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT IT BE LABELED IN CANADIAN STORES, EITHER. &gt;&gt; PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO HAVE THEIR FISH LABELED. AND THEY SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE EATING &gt;&gt; Reporter: AND IF IT DOES END UP BEING DISTRIBUTED IN A STORE LIKE THIS? &gt;&gt; NOBODY WILL KNOW. THERE'S NO IDEA. &gt;&gt; Reporter: IT IS A FACT THAT SOMEBODY COULD BE EATING YOUR PRODUCT, AND THEY WOULDN'T KNOW WHY NOT JUST LABEL IT SO PEOPLE KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EATING? &gt;&gt; AS A SMALL COMPANY, WITH YOUR FIRST OFFERING, WITH A LIMITED QUANTITY, THERE'S A HUGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH JUST PUTTING A LABEL, \"GENETICALLY-MODIFIED, GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED,\" ON IT. IF IT'S IDENTICAL TO THE TRADITIONAL FOOD, WHY... WHY PUT A LABEL ON IT? &gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT ITS D.N.A. HAS BEEN ALTERED. &gt;&gt; IT'S THE SAME PROTEINS, THE SAME FOOD THAT YOU'VE BEEN CONSUMING FOREVER. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT NOT EVERYONE THINKS IT'S THAT SIMPLE. &gt;&gt; AT A BARE MINIMUM, THEY MUST BE HONEST WITH THE CONSUMER WITH WHAT YOU'RE FEEDING YOUR FAMILY. &gt;&gt; THE SENATOR FROM ALASKA. &gt;&gt; Reporter: TO SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI OF ALASKA, THE ISSUE OF LABELING IS SUCH A BIG DEAL THAT SHE SINGLE-HANDEDLY DELAYED THE SALE OF AQUADVANTAGE SALMON IN THE U.S. FOR YEARS. &gt;&gt; \"FRANKENFISH\" IS WHAT WE CALL IT BECAUSE IT IS\\SO\\UNNATURAL. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AS A MEMBER OF THE POWERFUL APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE, MURKOWSKI ATTACHED A RIDER TO A BUDGET BILL THAT BLOCKED THE G.E. SALMON FROM BEING SOLD IN THE U.S. UNTIL THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE CAME UP WITH RULES FOR HOW IT MUST BE MURKOWSKI'S HOME STATE OF ALASKA IS ALSO THE NATION'S LEADING SEAFOOD PRODUCER. ITS MASSIVE, WILD-CAUGHT PACIFIC SALMON INDUSTRY IS A SOURCE OF STATE PRIDE. MURKOWSKI EVEN CAUGHT THE HUGE PACIFIC SALMON MOUNTED ON HER OFFICE WALL HERSELF. HOW MUCH OF THIS IS ABOUT OPPOSING THIS TECHNOLOGY, AND PROTECTING THAT INDUSTRY AND THE POLITICS SURROUNDING THAT? &gt;&gt; IT IS MORE THAN... THAN JUST AN INDUSTRY. IT IS... IT IS AN IDENTITY, AND IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE SO KEENLY TIED TO. THE LAST THING WE NEED IS THE INTRODUCTION OF... OF SOME GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED, MUTATED SPECIES THAT COULD COMPETE WITH OUR WILD STOCKS FOR... FOR FOOD AND WITHIN HABITAT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: WHAT MURKOWSKI'S WORRIED ABOUT IS THE NEW G.E. SALMON SOMEHOW ESCAPING AND MINGLING WITH ALASKA'S WILD SPECIES EVEN THOUGH THE ONLY PLACES G.E. SALMON IS APPROVED TO BE GROWN NOW ARE THE AQUABOUNTY FACILITIES IN CANADA AND INDIANA, FROM WHICH THE F.D.A. SAID THERE'S AN \"EXTREMELY LOW LIKELIHOOD\" OF ESCAPE. IN CANADA, THE AQUABOUNTY FACILITY DOES SIT RIGHT ACROSS FROM A RIVER THAT FLOWS INTO THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. &gt;&gt; ALL THE WATER THAT'S COMING THROUGH HERE GOES THROUGH THESE CONTAINMENT BARRIERS, THESE SOCK FILTERS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT, RON STOTISH SAYS, ANY WATER DISCHARGED INTO THE RIVER FLOWS THROUGH AT LEAST FIVE SEPARATE FILTERS INSIDE AND MORE BARRIERS OUTSIDE. &gt;&gt; THE LIKELIHOOD OF A... A TWO OR THREE KILO SALMON GOING THROUGH ONE OF THOSE FILTERS, THROUGH ONE OF THOSE BOXES, AND RUNNING OUT ACROSS THE STREET AND GOING THROUGH IS... IS VIRTUALLY ZERO. WE'VE BEEN OPERATING FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS, AND WE'VE NEVER LOST A SINGLE FISH. &gt;&gt; Reporter: HE KNOWS THIS BECAUSE EVERY FISH IS MICROCHIPPED AND TRACKED. AND EVEN IF THEY DID ESCAPE, ALMOST NONE COULD BREED WITH ORDINARY SALMON BECAUSE AQUABOUNTY USES A PROCESS THAT IT SAYS RENDERS ABOUT 99% OF THEM STERILE. &gt;&gt; SO, I THINK THAT WE ARE AS SAFE AS... AS WE CAN BE. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AQUACULTURE EXPERT YONATHAN ZOHAR LEADS THE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE BIOTECHNOLOGY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND. HE PROVIDED EXPERTISE TO THE F.D.A. WHEN IT WAS DECIDING WHETHER TO APPROVE THE GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED SALMON. ZOHAR DOES BELIEVE THE STERILIZATION TECHNOLOGY CAN BE IMPROVED AND IS CURRENTLY DOING RESEARCH ON JUST THAT. &gt;&gt; WE DEVELOPED A NEW TECHNOLOGY TO REDUCE... TO PRODUCE STERILE &gt;&gt; Reporter: BUT FOR NOW, ZOHAR SAYS THERE'S ANOTHER REASON NOT TO FEAR ESCAPED G.E. SALMON; STUDIES SHOW THEY WOULDN'T SURVIVE LONG IN THE WILD. &gt;&gt; THEY WILL NOT LAST FOR VERY LONG. WILD FISH ARE OUTCOMPETING THEM WHEN THEY'RE EXPOSED TO MOTHER NATURE-TYPE OF CONDITIONS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: ZOHAR ALSO WANTS TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE PROBABLY ALREADY EATING A LOT OF GENETICALLY-MODIFIED FOOD. &gt;&gt; I MEAN, IN THIS COUNTRY, ABOUT 70% OF ALL THE PLANTABLE CROPS ARE GENETICALLY- ENGINEERED, AND PEOPLE DON'T BLINK TWICE ABOUT IT. WE ARE FACING A MAJOR, SIGNIFICANT SEAFOOD CRISIS. SIMPLY SAID, MORE PEOPLE EAT MORE FISH, AND, AS A RESULT, WE ARE FISHING OUT AND EMPTYING OUR OCEANS. IF YOU ARE GOING TO USE GENETIC ENGINEERING AND PRODUCE A FISH THAT IS GOING TO MAKE IT TO THE MARKET SIZE IN HALF THE TIME, THIS WILL BE HUGE. THIS WILL HELP AQUACULTURE ACTUALLY MEET THE CHALLENGE AND BECOME THE INDUSTRY THAT WE NEED IT TO BECOME SO WE STOP FISHING OUT THE OCEANS. &gt;&gt; Reporter: AQUABOUNTY IS BETTING ON IT. IN MARCH, THE COMPANY GOT THE GREEN LIGHT TO START BUSINESS IN THE U.S. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THE U.S.D.A. ISSUED LABELING GUIDELINES FOR ALL GENETICALLY- ENGINEERED FOODS. THERE ARE A FEW LABELING OPTIONS-- PRINTING A SYMBOL OR THE WORD \"BIOENGINEERED\" ON THE PACKAGE, OR COMPANIES CAN PRINT INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO GET MORE INFORMATION. BUT SOME OF THOSE INSTRUCTIONS DON'T HAVE TO MENTION THE WORD \"BIOENGINEERED.\" AND THAT'S A PROBLEM FOR SENATOR LISA MURKOWSKI. &gt;&gt; YOU CAN GO TO THE BAR CODE SCANNER, IF YOU WILL, AND... AND GET A... A READING, BUT YOU DON'T... YOU DON'T HAVE THE LABEL THAT SAYS THAT IT IS GENETICALLY-ENGINEERED. AND THAT'S WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. THE F.D.A. DIDN'T HAVE ANY MANDATORY LABELING REQUIREMENT. &gt;&gt; Reporter: MURKOWSKI'S PUSHING A BILL TO MAKE THE LABELING MORE EXPLICIT. BUT NONE OF THIS WILL MATTER IF AQUABOUNTY'S SALMON END UP IN RESTAURANTS OR SIMILAR INSTITUTIONS BECAUSE NO LABELING IS REQUIRED THERE. IN THE MEANTIME, AQUABOUNTY'S GEARING UP PRODUCTION AT ITS INDIANA FACILITY, AND ITS SALMON COULD HIT THE U.S. MARKET AS EARLY AS THE FALL OF 2020.",

This as the government is considering whether to lift a three-year import ban on Genetically Modified Organisms. But the introduction of the crop, insect resistant maize, will depend on whether Kenyans opposed to GMOs will have raised credible evidence on why they should not be grown in the open. Already a consumer lobby group has threatened to go to court if the government does not present sufficient evidence to prove transgenic crops are safe for humans and the environment. So far GMO crops in the country have been grown either in laboratories or greenhouses to avoid possible environmental contamination.",

            "transcript": " it feels preposterous and maybe even embarrassing to stand here twenty thirteen to say to you that we have the right to know what's in our food that's exactly what i want to talk about tonight and i want to speak about the fact that the U.S. does not mandate labelling of genetically engineered organisms you would know GE organisms they are otherwise known as GMOs these are plants or animals that have had their genetic makeup altered to exhibit traits that are not naturally theirs and this is actually accomplished by the transfer of genetic material from one species to another in a way that could never happen in nature or frankly through traditional breeding the leading biotech firms will go to great lengths on their websites to distinguish between genetically-engineered crops patented crop to pay on and those that they have developed through traditional breeding method and so they really are quite different and i wanna argued to you today that our federal government's failure to mandate transparency to mandate labeling of these new life forms is a complete breach of its responsibility to we the people and and i want to argue that we have a role in making that happen and argue also that the federal government's failure to actively engaged in the science of long-term risk assessment of these new life forms is also a breach now interestingly one aspect of our one part of a federal government absolutely recognizes these crops as completely unique but U.S. patent office has given out hundreds of patents identifying these as absolutely distinctive new form that can be in fact owned and as you know these patents have been very successfully defended with tens of millions of dollars farmers who saved crops who saved seeds when their farms have been inadvertently contaminated with genetic uh... material or transgenic crops from nearby farms of accident successfully prosecuted for patent infringement now at the FDA on the other hand we have the exact opposite point of view the FDA's point of view for twenty years since nineteen ninety two keep in mind of these cops were introduced in nineteen ninety-six commercially but since nineteen ninety two the FDAs policy has been that these crops are substantially equivalent they are materially the same because they exhibit similar organ elliptic taste or smell characteristics or similar nutritional uh... characteristics and therefore it is determined that we should not be uh... they're not material to us to know and it's important to understand that this voluntary guidelines opted by the FDA in nineteen ninety two was not a result of input by the people are represented as this did not come out of congress a result of a process led by the council on competitiveness council competitiveness chaired by then Dan Quayle who you might recall and they it was actually a very brilliant move on the part of industry to enlist vice president quayle in creating this effort because this is in fact in the law of the land today even though there have been enormous changes over that time for example ninety percent of selling now out there is genetically engineered eighty five percent of corn is now genetically-engineered what this means is that over seventy five percent of the processed foods we're now contains genetically-engineered materials been incredibly successful but the data as overwhelmingly clear but the average citizen knows nothing about this now in fifty five nations around the world actually take the exact opposite view that when these crops are approved for commercialization labeling is absolutely required really progressive countries like well first of all of the EU and most of our trading partners but really progressive countries like russia china even syria have mandated labeling now you may wonder why did these countries offer liberties to their status is that we in the land of the free don't have that I assure you is beyond the scope of my discussion today but it has something to do with corporate influence in washington i'm pretty sure the reality is...the question that you must we must ask is are they safe and that's a very important question but it's actually not material to whether they should be labelled this has become a kind of a smokescreen when these companies say well they're materially the same and a perfectly safe if a crop or an additive or process is found to be unsafe it's not just put on the label it's banned this is not about whether it's safer not this is about the fact that under the federal food drug and cosmetic act the FDA is required is accountable to to make us aware of processes or ingredients that alter or materially change the food in a way that is not obvious to us so in the case of irradiation where we have mandatory labeling of irradiation nobody has proven irradiated foods are harmful or uh... but there is a recognition in DC that this process is of concern to our citizens it is therefore and therefore labeling is required and it's important note that the irradiation have not five takes there actually proud of their technology and it's interesting to contrast that with the chemical companies who own these GE crops the reality is is that we have lots of examples like this we have farm raised versus wild, we have orange juice from concentrate we have country of origin these are processes where you can say it's safe or unsafe and you can say that they're materially uh... similar but these are processes that concern people what i'm arguing is that we shouldn't be labeling we don't need to be labeling because they're proven to be safe or unsafe although there is something that i want to say about that in just a moment but rather because we are introducing new bacteria, new genetic material we are introducing new proteins that have never before been in these foods that is material to us now i do want to raise the concern because it's widely held out there that the lack of independent testing to determine substantial equivalence or similarity is is a problem nearly all of the conclusions of substantial equivalence have resulted from studies either conducted by the patent holders or funded by the and indeed this is important many of the promises by these very same have in fact gone unfulfilled we have a corn out there that's widely used that has an insecticide built into it called bt a formerly effective insecticide that has done a nice job of controlling root worms but we were told that this...at the time that this crop was being... was filing for approval that this bt insecticide would never survive in the human digestive system in fact that it would be destroyed by our saliva within seconds of consuming it now we have absolute input evidence and and published studies from two years ago that show the bt toxins are present in the core blood of pregnant women we literally have ingested these insecticides and they continue inside us numerous national academy of science revealed that well there are all kinds of reasons to believe that we may be introducing new toxins and new allergens in these cops but unlike with drugs where we have mandatory testing on animals mandatory human clinical trials mandatory trials of carcinogenicity of fetal impact, neurological and at least some limited allergy testing none of that is required believe it or not for these crops so there may be chronic problems happening across the country there may be links to the explosion of allergies that everyone of us is seeing around us but we have, epidemiologists have absolutely no way of knowing because without labeling we don't know if we're eating this stuff now there are lots of reasons to label there are allergen concerns there are concerns about independent testing their religious concerns my friends in the religious community refer to GMOs as god moving over, they just don't like messing with god's work and i will tell you that the mellman group has done research showing that ninety two percent of americans when given the choice say that they prefer to know whether these crops or ingredients are in our food or not actually what they said there's no statistical difference between republicans democrats or independents and in fact what they also said that ninety two percent of americans don't agree on anything so this is a very meaningful meaningful statistic now let me say what is material from my vantage point we were told by these very same chemical companies on these crops when herbicide tolerant crops were that which is the primary gene available in these when they were first introduced we were they would actually result in a reduction of herbicide usage but here's actually what's happened we have seen since nineteen ninety six since these crops were introduced a 527 million pound increase and herbicides in 1996 we used 14 million pounds of herbicides on the three leading commodity crops, last year we use over 300 pounds of these herbicides and the single dependence on these herbicides is creating all kinds of issues and never before really seen out there but for example the USGS, the united states geological survey reports that we are now finding glyphosate herbicide in the air in the spring in the summer throughout our rural communities and of course through drift everybody uh... downwind from this is breathing this stuff so we're literally breathing herbicides now and drinking it in our water with insecticides where again we've seen the second leading trait that's been developed is insecticide tolerance uh... we have seen a decrease actually this is good news, of 123 million pounds in the same period since these crops but we have this problem now which is that new studies have come out in the last year and a half, two years, that the corn borer, the corn root worm is now becoming resistant to what was used to be a very effective insecticide and again as i mentioned this insecticide is now present literally in our bodies and we're carrying it around with us and this indeed is uh... not uh... at all what was promised with these crops now i wish i could tell you that this was the end of the problem it's actually in fact the beginning because going along with the overuse of these herbicides has been an explosion of herbicide resistance out there twenty three different weeds are growing in more than half the states in this country on millions of acres that are now resistant they're no longer affected by which in smaller doses dosages used to affect them and so what the chemical companies have said is well farmers need to use stronger herbicides 2,4D, Dicamba, you may understand the last time you heard is that it was fifty percent of agent orange and we're now using this widely across the country and in fact now new crops are being introduced that are genetically bred to be resistant to 2,4D and Dicamba in fact the weed science society of america is meeting later this month for a major uh... discussion and debate on this exact issue that we have essentially sentenced ourselves to chemical inflation, kind of an environmental and health train wreck and we're becoming more and more depending on these chemicals so this is a very brilliant brilliant business model the crop, the companies that own seeds make money by selling the seeds, they are and then they make money selling the chemicals that we are now becoming addicted to and required and we need stronger and stronger uh... in 2010 the President's cancer panel came out and reported that forty one percent of americans are going to be diagnosed with cancers in our lifetime and the smoking gun that this prestigious referred to in this study is chemicals, primarily herbicides and pesticides, in our air, water, soil and months after this study came out out we had a study, a peer reviewed study reporting an absolute correlation between pesticide exposure and ADHD which is really an epidemic in our society so what we have here is a very simple situation let me summarize it we have no clarity yet on whether these crops themselves are inherently safe or not and we're not going to have that clarity for probably a generation yet at the same time we absolutely know that there's a direct relationship between using these cops and increasing chemical use- I would call that material to the average consumer This is no longer 1992 the twenty-year-old regulation that was the law of the land before these crops were introduced it's time to review them, we now know that this is chemical armageddon We have americans want to know, we are using more chemicals, the FDA can label, it's time for us to simply label very simply this is more than a fight for labeling, this is a fight about whether our government is of, for and by or of, for and by a handful of chemical and I invite you to learn more and join us at justlabelit.org Thank you",

            "transcript": " Natural selection tends to favour plants that can compete for light, water and nutrients, defend themselves from being eaten, and disperse their seed over long distances These characteristics are in direct conflict with the goals of agriculture, where farmers want plants to invest as many of their resources as possible into making nutritious, easy to harvest products. Genetic improvement has been a central pillar of improved agricultural productivity for 1000s of years with modern crop varieties being much higher yielding and generally more nutritious than their wild ancestors. Even with our modern crop varieties, continued improvement is both possible and necessary to meet growing demand. New characteristics can be introduced into crops using either conventional cross breeding or Genetic Modification (GM for short). The characteristics of all living organisms, such as size, colour and shape, are determined by their genes and their interaction with the environment. With improvements in our knowledge about which plant genes do what, we now know many genes that could contribute to improving sustainable food production. In some cases, conventional breeding will be the best way to deploy these genes that is by cross breeding the crop variety with the plant that contains the genes providing these characteristics. In other cases, GM, where scientists take a gene and insert it directly into a crop, might be easier, or indeed the only way they can be deployed. If you want to discover more about how GM is done, if it's safe and effective, or what GM plants are grown and where, you can find the answers to these and many other questions about GM in the independent, fact-based Q&amp;A available on our website.",

            "transcript": " Hi! My name is Hank Green and this is SciShow! We made a movie about this before,  but some of the sources we used have proven to be untrustworthy, and we really don't think so  that we were completely told how we are doing with genetic modification  here at SciShow.  Why is GMO bad? It is not - neither in itself, and especially not  for your health. We have eaten it for decades without any harmful effects, which gives  many, for a GMO is just an organism like any other organism,  that make hundreds of thousands of proteins, but which one or two of them are special  selected by us humans.  Genetic modification is necessary for man's continued success here on planet Earth.  Just as the discovery of nitrogen fixation gave us more fertile fields which saved  millions from starvation death, the fruit of genetic modification (quite literally) will help  to meet the great challenges of a world with more people and a climate there  is less and less stable.  Like the nitrogen fix, Germany allowed to build bigger bombs,  genetic modification is a tool that can be used for both good and evil. Therefore, it must be investigated,  controlled and understood. And this understanding starts right here and now with us!  If you live in the United States, you've almost certainly eaten Genetically Modified Organisms,  or GMO: So far, there are only plants, but virtually all kinds of meat on the market  probably got GMO feed.  And it won't be long before the animals themselves are genetically modified. IN 2012  the FDA approved a new type of Atlantic salmon modified to have higher levels of  growth hormone, using genes from Pacific salmon and some kind of eel squash.  They concluded that the modified fish was completely safe and opened the discussion to the public,  but no final decision has yet been made.  GMOs are found everywhere in the United States, quite literally. 95% of sugar beet, 88% of corn,  94% of soybeans grown in the United States have properties - which. eg. insect resistance, or resistance to herbicides-  which they have obtained through genetic modification.  Some crops have been genetically modified just for the benefit of humans. About 500,000 children  becomes blind each year due to vitamin A deficiency. A rice variety has been developed there,  Unlike regular rice, has enough vitamin A to keep children healthy. Or faster,  at least.  The very word \"genetically modified\" is not true.  Humans have been genetically modified since inventing agriculture.  Every plant species and every animal species has natural variation and the gene pool, and for millennia we have  exploited this variation by practicing artificial selection. We grow and breed organisms  to express their most attractive qualities: runs that make more milk, squash plants that can  survive the drought. Brassica oleracea, better known as wild cabbage, has been bred so intensively  that it is the wild ancestor of half a dozen different garden crops, including broccoli,  cabbage, cauliflower, Brussels sprouts, cabbage rabbit and kale.  Corn initially looked like this. We have made it through years of selective breeding  a giant mutant version that we happily put on the grill without  to think of the centuries of breeding that made it possible to turn a grass seed into a sweet one  and starchy masterpiece.  But when we talk about GMO today, we're really talking about genetically modified  organisms, or transgenic organisms. We're talking about genes from one species there  taken out and then transferred to the genome in another species. This is called transgenesis,  and although not all GMO foods are made this way, transgenic crops are far  the most common kind of genetically modified organism encountered.  There is just that: modified organisms are not new either - we have  peeled at the food in laboratories for almost a hundred years.  In the 1920s, scientists found that they could induce mutations in plants - and thereby  make more genetic variation, and possibly more beneficial traits - by exposing them to  X-rays, gamma rays and various chemicals. In the 1970s, these mutation methods became  quite popular and they were even completely unregulated and ignored by the public.  Thousands of crops formed in this way are on the market today.  It's a pretty rough method - tick the genes, plant the seeds and see  what's happening, and then breed on the cool new properties so we get a new kind of crop.  In 1983, they invented a new technique that took away a gene  an antibiotic-resistant bacterium and spliced \u200b\u200bit into the DNA of a tobacco plant.  Antibiotic-resistant tobacco obviously has no purpose, but it proved that  one could transmit single genes. A new kind of transgenetics was born.  However, the GMO industry was not able to get a grip until 1994, when the USDA approved  a tomato called Flavr Savr, which was invented by a California biotech company.  The tomato had changed so that it matured slowly and therefore stayed longer.  It was the first genetically modified crop sold to consumers.  However, the Flavr Savr tomato didn't last long - partly because people didn't like the taste,  and partly because Europe in particular was suspicious of its genetics  changes. Flavr Savr, and its barely-so-good taste, sparked a debate there still  going on merrily.  Today, most GMOs cannot be found in the vegetable department, but on the contrary  more than 90% of GMO crops are known as  fodder corn and soybeans, which have been modified to withstand weeds or insects. These crops  used as ingredients in lots of processed food we eat, or used as  feed for animals that we later enjoy eating the meat from.  The best known crop of this kind is the so-called Round-up clear crops -  soybeans, maize, sugar beet, cotton, alfalfa and canola, modified to:  could handle the herbicide RoundUp.  These crops give us some \"edible\" examples of how transgenic  foods are made, which is why they are made as they are, what they can  and what they cannot.  Let's look at why they were made. The active substance i  the herbicide RoundUp is glyphosate, a chemical that inhibits an enzyme that plants use  to form amino acids. By blocking this enzyme, RoundUp causes the plants to stop producing the substances they need  in order to grow and transform food, and thus it kills them. It works on all plants.  It works so well that they can be difficult to use near plants you do not want to kill,  such as. Crops.  In the 1990s, the company Monsanto, which produces RoundUp, decided to develop crops there  could withstand glyphosate so that farmers could spray the herbicide all over their field,  but only kill the weeds.  There are some microorganisms that make an enzyme that is unaffected by glyphosate.  Monsanto just had to transfer these bacterial genes to crop plants, and so could  farmers use RoundUp to protect their crops without killing them. Small pieces were therefore taken  bacterial DNA encoding the enzyme in question and trying to find out  how to get them into plants.  How to get genes from a bacterium into the cell nucleus of a plant cell. On the Tree of Life  plants and bacteria are not even on the same branch! It turns out that there is one  couple of interesting ways.  The first is a gene cannon.  You heard right: gene guns!  Gene guns do what one would think: literally and slightly chaotic they shoot  DNA into plant cells. They are often used to modify maize and rice species. They use  tiny gold particles covered with hundreds of pieces of DNA from the donor gene  which is called a transgene. The plant cells that will receive the new genes  placed in a vacuum chamber and then released. The DNA-covered gold particles are shot  on the cells using compressed air.  When the gold enters the cell nucleus, it dissolves and the researchers then cross fingers  for the DNA to be taken up by the chromosomes in the cell nucleus, and sometimes  Did it succeed! Once transgenic is inserted into the plant's DNA, it can  themselves are further bred on.  It's not that elegant, but it's much more gentle than just bombarding the seed  with radiation and then hope for the best.  Another newer and more effective method of forming transgenic organisms is provided  to use terrestrial bacteria named Agrobacterium. It is a plant parasite and is nature's own genetic engineer -  it has a little extra piece of DNA called a plasmid that can come  out of the bacterium and implant itself into a plant cell.  In the wild, Agrobacterium uses this little trick to re-encode the plant cells to make them  food for the bacterium. In the laboratory we can use the plasmid some kind of carrier for  smart transgenes, and use it to insert new genetic material into plant cells.  Whether using agrobacterium or gene guns, you now have a new one modified  crop. But it can't just be stuck in the ground -  one has to have the new properties over in the traditional crop plants.  This last step is called back crossing, and involves repeated crossings of the new transgene  plant with crop plants, again and again until you have a new transgenic crop.  Eventually, Monsanto had a patented plant that could withstand spraying  with glyphosate. In the past, plants had to be set at a certain distance  for machines to remove weeds, and it caused land losses and expenses for the farmer,  not to mention high fuel consumption. In addition, Monsanto gets a whole new customer group to buy  It's a long process - the whole molevite can take up to 15 years - but it is  so the way almost all genetic modification takes place in your food,  whether plugging the antibiotic resistance of a bacterium into a tobacco plant or eel worm  growth pattern into a salmon.  Then you have to go through the process of approving the crop or animal,  and it can take many years as well. It is therefore very expensive, but there are  some new technologies that may eventually make it cheaper.  The fact that it is so expensive, yet can pay off, shows where  extremely beneficial GMO crops can be. It also means the companies that make them  keeping them under strict control, and limiting the patents, the cultivation, and even the research as  performed on the crops.  One of the reasons why the fierce attacks on GMOs is not scientific  consequences of their existence, but the economic and cultural consequences of placing  so much power over our food supply in the hands of very few very large companies.  The GMO debate has therefore become a surrogate debate for a much larger debate on economics,  that, frankly, is beyond our reach.  However, there are scientific concerns about GMO food. How to influence  insertion of a single gene, instead of e.g. replace a large piece of the genome, the rest of the genome?  We used to think that it did not affect at all, but it turns out that  the genome is much more complex than that.  Many farmers store non-patented seeds for next year's sowing, but that is not allowed  with patented GMO crops. If your very ordinary seeds became inadvertent  pollinated with a GMO crop, could the seeds you had saved from  last year's harvest, contain genes belonging to some others. And the others,  will sue you. If your livelihood depends on selling certified organic crops or  selling to markets where GMOs are banned can have even greater consequences.  Furthermore, the properties we give to the crops can have ecological consequences:  if we make insect resistance we should make sure that we do not damage insects  which we like, such as bees and butterflies.  After it has been eaten through hundreds of millions of meals by me and probably off  you, and been investigated for decades, there has been zero evidence that  GMO food should be dangerous to human health.  However, it has not stopped loud opponents from supporting miserable studies, and  publish misleading articles.  Here at SciShow, we have even quoted an article claiming that GMOs increase risk  for cancer in rats. The study was done by a guy who didn't quite accidentally publish a book  on the subject the same week as the article was published in a scientific journal,  and was taken for good. But it turned out that data were particularly selected, that there was a lack of effect, that the samples were small  and that the line of rats he was using already had a risk of getting a full 0% cancer, which is why the study  eventually discredited.  As with all new technologies, this can also have unforeseen consequences:  It can be controlled and monopolized and even turned into weapons, so there is plenty of good reason  to keep an eye on the companies that are developing it.  But given the number of hungry people on the planet, we have a commitment  to explore all possibilities to increase the amount of crops, and to limit the amount  of herbicides, insecticides, energy and water consumed in our agriculture. Traditional and advanced  Breeding methods have to be part of this, and so does genetic modification.

            "transcript": " Translator: DAHOU Mohamed Checker: Hani Eldalees  I am a plant geneticist.  I have studied genotypes that make plants resistant to disease  And able to withstand stress.  In the last years,  Millions of people around the world are beginning to believe  I am something sinister about genetic modification.  Today, I'm here to offer a different perspective.  First, let me introduce my husband, Raul.  He is an organic farmer.  He cultivates in his field a variety of different crops.  He is one of many practitioners of environmental agriculture  This agricultural pattern is used to keep its field healthy.  Imagine some of the reactions we face as a couple:  \"Really? An environmentalist and plant geneticist?  Can you agree on anything? \"  Well, yes, we can, and that is not difficult because we have the same goal.  We want to help feed the growing population  Without further destroying the environment.  I think this is the greatest challenge of our time.  Now, genetic modification is nothing new,  Virtually everything we eat has been genetically modified  In some way.  Let me give some examples.  On the left is a picture  Of the ancient ancestor of modern corn.  You see one row of grain covered with a harsh crust.  Unless you have a hammer  Thiocent is not good for the tortilla industry.  Now, take a look at the old banana ancestor.  You can see the big seeds.  The cabbage shoots small appetite  The eggplant, very beautiful.  Now, to produce these varieties  Crop breeders have used many genetic techniques over the years.  Some of them are very innovative,  As hybrids of two different species together  Using a process called grafting of plants  To produce this type half tomatoes and the other half potatoes.  Crop breeders also used other types of genetic techniques,  Like random genetic mutations  That lead to undistorted mutations  In plants.  The rice cereals that most of us provide to our children  Have been developed using this approach.  Today, crop breeders have more options to choose from.  Some are very accurate.  I want to show you a few examples of my own business.  I work on rice, the staple food for more than half of the world's population.  Every year, 40% of the crop  It is lost due to pests and diseases.  That's why farmers grow rice varieties  Withstand resistance genes.  This approach has been used for almost a hundred years.  However, when I started my college,  No one knew what these genes were.  Until 1990, when scientists finally discovered  Genetic basis of resistance.  In my lab, we isolated a gene for its immunity  A very serious bacterial disease in Asia and Africa.  We found that we could engineer the gene and insert it into a traditional type of rice  Was usually susceptible to the disease,  You can see the two papers below  They have high resistance to infection.  Now, the same month that my laboratory was published  Our discovery of the immune gene in rice,  My friend and colleague (Dave McKell) stopped at my desk.  \"70 million rice farmers have rice breeding problems,\" he said.  This is because their fields were flooded with water  These farmers live on less than $ 2 a day.  Although rice grows well in stagnant water  Most of them die if they are flooded with water  For more than three days.  Floods are expected to become an increasingly problematic issue  Due to climate changes.  He also told me that he and his student Kenong Shaw  They were studying an old type of rice that had an amazing property.  It can withstand two weeks even after it is completely submerged.  He asked me if I was willing to help them to isolate this gene  I said yes, I was very excited, because I knew that if we succeed  We could help millions of farmers grow rice  Even if their fields were flooded.  He spent 10 years looking for this gene.  Then one day he said,  \"Come and take a look at this experience, you have to see this.\"  I went to the nursery and saw  That the traditional species died after being submerged for 18 days,  The type of rice we genetically engineered  With the new gene we discovered called \"Sub1\" he was still alive.  Kenong and I were surprised and excited  The fact that one gene has this great effect.  But this was an experience at the nursery only.  Will this work in the field?  Now, I'll show you a video shot for four months  At the International Rice Research Institute.  Breeders developed a type of rice that carries the gene \"Sub1\"  Using a different genetic technique called micro-breeding  On the left, you can see the type that holds Sub1  And on the right there is the traditional type  Both types did well at first  But after the field was submerged for 17 days  You can see the type that holds Sub1 looks great  In fact, it produces three and a half more grains  More than the traditional type  I love this video  Because it shows the ability of plant genetics to help farmers  Last year, with the help of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation  3.5 million farmers managed to grow rice \"Sub1\"  (clap)  thank you  Now, many people don't mind genetic modification  When it comes to modifying rice genes  Rice genotypes in rice plants  Or even when it comes to mixing species together  By vaccination or random mutations  But when it comes to taking genes from viruses or bacteria  And put them in the plant  A lot of people say \"disgusting\"  Why are you doing this?  The reason is because sometimes it is cheaper and safer  And the most effective technology  To promote food security and sustainable agriculture development  I will give three examples.  First, take a look at papaya. It's appetite, isn't it?  Now take a look at this papaya  These papaya are infected with the \"cyclic\"  In 1950, this virus killed almost all production  Papaya on Oahu Island in Hawaii  Many people believed that papaya grown in Hawaii was doomed to failure  But then, someone from Hawaii  Plant Pathologist (Denis Gon\u00e7alves)  He decided to try to fight this disease using genetic engineering.  He took a piece of the DNA of the virus and inserted it  In papaya genes  Almost as humans get the vaccine  Now, take a look at his experimental field  You can see genetically engineered papaya in the middle  It has immunity from infection  Traditional papaya abroad has been seriously infected with the virus  Thanks to saving the papaya industry, Dennis's pioneering work  Today, after 20 years, there is no other way to control the disease  There's no membership method. There's no traditional way.  80% of papaya grown in Hawaii is genetically engineered  Now, some of you may still feel that viral genes are not digestible in food  But consider this:  Genetically engineered papaya carries only a trace of the virus  But if you bite something organic or traditional papaya  Infected with the virus  You've bitten 10 times more viral protein  Now, take a look at this scourge that makes a feast on the eggplant  This brown you see is \"hangover\"  What comes out of the back of the insect  To control this dangerous pest  Which can destroy the whole eggplant crop in Bangladesh  Farmers sprayed pesticides  Two or three times a week  Sometimes twice a day, when the pressure of the lesion is high  But we know that some insecticides are very harmful to human health  Especially when the farmer and his family cannot  Provide appropriate protection, such children  In less developed countries, an estimated 300,000 people die annually  Due to misuse and exposure to pesticides  Scientists in Bangladesh and Cornell University have decided to fight the disease  Using genetic techniques built on organic farming approaches  Organic farmers like my husband Raul are spraying insecticides called PT.  Made up of bacteria  This type of pesticide only targets pests caused by butterflies larvae  In fact, it is nontoxic to humans, fish, and birds.  It is less toxic than table salt  But this approach does not work for Bangladesh  This is because these pesticides  Few exist because they are expensive.  It also does not prevent the insect from entering the plant  As for the genetic approach, scientists have cut the gene from the bacteria  And insert it directly into the eggplant's DNA  Will this reduce pesticide spraying in Bangladesh?  Certainly.  Last season, farmers reported that they were able to reduce pesticide use  By an enormous amount, almost to zero.  They are able to harvest and plant again for the next season  Now, I have provided two examples of the uses of genetic engineering  To fight pests and diseases  And to reduce the quantities of pesticides  The last example I will give would be about  Use genetic engineering to reduce malnutrition  500,000 children become blind every year due to vitamin A deficiency  More than half of them will die  That's why scientists with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation  Genetically engineered golden rice  To produce beta-carotene, the substance that produces vitamin A.  This is the same chromosome that we found on the islands  Researchers estimated that one cup of golden rice per day  It will save the lives of thousands of children  But golden rice has been strongly opposed  By activists opposed to genetic modification  In the last year,  Activists destroyed an experimented field in the Philippines  When I heard about this destruction,  I wondered if they knew they were destroying much more  From a scientific urging project,  They are destroying medicines that children desperately needed  To keep their eyesight and their lives  Some of my friends and family are still worried:  How can you know that genes in food are edible?  I explained to them genetic engineering,  The process of gene transfer between species,  Have been used for over 40 years  In wine, in medicine, in plants, in cheese  All that time, there was not a single case of damage  For human health or for the environment  But I said, look, I won't ask you to believe me  Science is not a belief system,  My opinion is not important.  Let's look at the evidence  After 20 years of careful study and careful reviews  Done by thousands of independent scientists  Every major scientific organization in the world has ended  That crops are now on the market safe to eat  And the process of genetic engineering  No more dangerous than the old methods of genetic modification  These are exactly the same organizations that most of us trust  When it comes to other important scientific issues  Such as global climate change or vaccine safety  (Raul) And I believe that, instead of worrying about genes in our food,  We have to focus on helping children grow up healthy  We must ask if peasants in the countryside can flourish  If everyone can buy food.  We should try to reduce the environmental decline  What scares me most is the wrong arguments and information  About plant genetics  The poorest people who desperately need technology  They may be denied access because of concerns and prejudices  For those who have enough to eat  We have a huge challenge ahead  Let us celebrate and use scientific innovation  It's our responsibility  To do everything we can to help alleviate human suffering  And environmental protection  thank you.  Chris Anderson: You argued strongly  Who argue against GMOs  As I understand it, their objections come from two things  The first is the complexity and unintended consequences.  Nature is an incredibly complex machine  If we put the genes that we created  Those that have not been intercepted during years of development  And began to mingle with the rest of the genes abroad  Isn't it possible that this could lead to disaster or trouble?  Especially when we add it to the trade incentive  That some companies offer to those who can do it.  The fear is that having those incentives  Means that the decision was not made on a scientific basis  Even so, there will be unintended consequences  How do we know there is little risk of some unintended consequences?  Often our unskilled intervention in nature leads to unintended consequences  And a series of reactions  PAMELA RONALD: Well about the commercial aspects  One thing really important to understand is  That in the developed world, farmers in the United States,  Almost all farmers, both organic and traditional  They buy seeds produced by seed companies  Inevitably, there is a commercial interest in selling many of them  But we hope they sell the seeds that farmers want to buy  This is different in the less developed world.  The farmers there can't buy seeds  These seeds were not sold  Seed is distributed free of charge  Through traditional licensed groups  So it is very important in less developed countries  Seed should be available free of charge  CA: Wouldn't some activists say this was part of the conspiracy?  This is heroin strategy  You sow the thing, people have no choice  But to be addicted to this seed forever?  Pamela: There are a lot of conspiracy theories of course, but they don't work that way  For example, seeds distributed, flood-resistant rice  These have been distributed free of charge  Through licensed Indian and Bengali seed agencies  So there's no commercial interest at all  Golden Rice was developed with the support of the Rockefeller Foundation.  Again, it was distributed free of charge  There is no commercial tout  In this case  Now to answer other questions, mix genes  Aren't there some unintended consequences?  definitely. Every time we do something different,  Have unintended consequences,  But one of the points I'm trying to make  We do crazy things for our plants  Mutations using radiation, or chemical mutations  This produces thousands of unknown mutations  This raises the possibility of unintended consequences  More than many modern methods.  For this it is really important not to use  Is called \"GMO\" because it makes no scientific sense  I feel it is very important to talk about a specific crop  A specific product, think about the needs of consumers  CA: So part of what's going on here, there's an intellectual model  For many people it is that: Nature is nature and is pure and unspoilt  Trying to change it is a Frankenstein method.  These attempts make pure things somehow dangerous  And I think what you're saying is that this model of thinking  Misunderstands how nature is  Nature is a messy interaction between genetic changes  This happens all the time  Pamela: That's right, there's nothing called \"pure food\"  I mean, it is possible not to spray eggplant with insecticides  Or genetically engineered, but you'll eat \"animal waste\"  So there is no purity  CA: Thank you, this was a strong debate  Pamela: Thank you very much. I really appreciate this ",
