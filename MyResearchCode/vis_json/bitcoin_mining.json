            "transcript": "  everyone's advice come here with tails right here in the sticks of Virginia and I'm in route to my mining shed which actually really isn't that far from my house if you guys know that but today I'm gonna be talking about Bitcoin mining and why I've made the executive decision which is a really cool way of saying that I just ran some numbers and it simply doesn't make any sense anymore to run my Bitcoin miners I'll actually be running I'm running at a loss here and it's gonna be a big gamble to try to make my money back so his tail sits there all awkwardly I'm gonna go ahead and take the time to show you in this video why if you want to gamble you may as well just sell your minor cut your losses if you're at one and if you're really so bullish on cryptocurrency like I am don't get me wrong my stump still bullish on cryptocurrency you should just put that money straight into the coin some of you guys have been falling for a while may know I have a really cool project plan for this miner that I still have not gotten around to doing but until then I'm just gonna have him sit here I believe because I just don't think that it's worth it to run a miner t9 was residential electric and I would have that bad of an electric rate tend to have cents per kilowatt out then we got an S 9 over here which actually isn't my original one we actually just recently got in you know it's just God locally and it's already gonna be going off to its new home because it just doesn't make sense to run anymore so say farewell buddy been fun said not really see you later Tina m+ sort of except you're pretty loud and you never really made that much money but at least you supported the network goodbye friend whether you want to or not sometimes you just have to pull so it's really easy to get down about cryptocurrency prices right now it's easy to get down and discouraged with the cryptocurrency mining earnings right now and to be honest the most discouraging thing of all is this difficulty chart aside from that one outlier if you look at the past six months the difficulty will clearly continue to rise and guess what has not really risen over the last six months yeah you guessed it that would be the Bitcoin price if you don't know Bitcoin readjust the difficulty every two weeks and we're actually kind of closing in on the last stretch of my noble bitcoins if you look at the available supply out of the 21 million that's available well then we're not too far off with a circulating supply of 17 million yeah there's still several more years of Bitcoin mining but regardless you know our circulating supply versus Max supply is getting pretty close also for those that don't know miners also received all the transaction fees paid as well as the block reward for every Bitcoin block that solved and moves the algorithm forward so even when there are no more bitcoins to mind there will still be money to be made running a Bitcoin mining machine however with these miners being priced so low it's still pretty alarming how it's actually gonna be pretty difficult to make your money back and again I'm a huge miner I love mining and this stuff is heartbreaking to see and realize but I'm not just gonna lie to you guys especially not gonna show this stuff especially if you know we're not in a good place here I've got two plugged in this is all going to be based around an a minor s9 that I got locally recently this model there's different models at different hash rates but this one's got 13 1/2 Terra hash a second which in Giga hash looks like that the power consumption is about 1300 watts we run into what to my estimated mining profit calculator it says after our electric cost of ten to half cents we're gonna be pulling in 20 cents per day if we run this based off the asic miner value comm chart which is a good way to estimate stuff they've gained a lot of popularity recently you can't enter 10 1/2 cents so I just run it up to 11 cents you can see I'm pretty much gonna lose money any way you look at it with any of these s9 models I mean making 12 cents a day to me is almost losing money and then just to go over here one of the old school calculators that you don't see talked about much anymore but last summer on the beat like in the beginning of last summer a crypto compare profit calculator was all the rage and a lot of people spend a lot of money just based off of this guy so again we got the thirteen half tear hash same walk consumption and this is estimated we're gonna lose four cents per day here's the number that's important I'm gonna grab the 0.015 one for Bitcoin quantity mind that's projecting over the next month and we put that into coin gecko right and that means we're gonna mine about hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin and bad news our electric bill is about $100 so we're not gonna make any money but let's say you have the ability to sit on your cryptocurrency right so you're gonna sit on that hundred dollars of Bitcoin and you know we'll just take a linear value if it doubles okay if Bitcoin doubles a price and you held everything and everything stayed relatively static which it never really does you'll make a hundred bucks a month so you would need to hold all of your Bitcoin for the next five months and Bitcoin would need to double and at least for you to make your money back just based off of this price but don't forget you also need a power supply it's allowed to be a cool hundred dollars so let's add another month so now we're a half a year also they're shipping fees and perhaps depending on where you live you'll pay customs so I'd like another 20 30 40 50 bucks and just like that you're looking at seven months maybe need a couple cables power supply cable Ethernet cable all congratulations it's not gonna take you eight months if Bitcoin doubles and again I'm really not trying to be negative guys but if the numbers just don't check out they just don't check out this is what you know you can see these going for on Amazon will list it for on eBay they're going for like 500 bucks right now and any way you slice it any way you look at it for the at-home residential minor it does not make sense to have a Bitcoin miner of this current generation for anyone who's been following the channel here for a while you know that I made a video where I had a couple good days on slush Poole mining with my aunt miner s9 I was making almost 50 bucks a day and that was at the end of that was in the end of December which is crazy because it hasn't really been that long to see such a dramatic drop with the exact same machine I also made an update in here in March so this is actually a pretty linear timeframe again you know that was in March now it's August into August 2018 and you can see the profits what these machines have basically disappeared so I also saw a really sad note down ears when tails have health issues those are terrible times and we're not totally in the clear yet but for everyone who's been following us along that long you can see right here in the stream she's just news around hey hey you're a good girl how does she know talking about her but she's doing good she's doing well everything we could ask for and above all all I ask this this she's still alive and can play some ball because she loves playing fetch other than that guys that really sums it up any way you slice it it just doesn't really make sense to buy sha-256 bitcoin bitcoin cash insert any kind of coin now here miner I'm not saying that no miners makes sense you know we've been talking some about the echo hash basics which I'm really worried are gonna be flooded in September but time will tell I mean that's just what happened with every single other ASIC ever so I'm sure there's mostly different guys that sarcasm if you don't know above all make sure subscribe to the Boskone youtube channel if you haven't already and if you stuck along this long in the video I want to show you something that I Edward Grubb our top secret a bit main spy showed me here and this has been leaked a couple other places already as well stuff half as fast but it's a liquid-cooled ant minor s9 that's pretty cool right when you actually look at the Hatcher I think it's like a teen terror hashes sack and you look at the power consumption I think it's like sixteen hundred watts or something crazy still doesn't make any sense but regardless it's really cool it's cool to see I mean how about what other liquid cooled ASIC miners have you seen besides the ASIC miner Co ones we have which we're still doing research on a lot of people don't really think are legitimate so perhaps the teardown is an order but anyway without further ado I want to thank you guys for viewing I got tails here we're actually gonna go to something that thanks to me we're gonna go to a fun event me miss Vause and tails here soon outdoors so I gotta get going but if you haven't hit that subscribe button hit the thumbs up on the video and I'll see you guys next time thanks for watching [Music] [Applause]",

            "title": "How to Mine Bitcoins Using Your Own Computer",
            "transcript": " Hey guys. I'm John from 99Bitcoins and today I'm going to teach you how to mine bitcoins at home using your very own computer in just a few simple steps. Now if you\u2019ve heard about Bitcoin you\u2019ve probably heard about Bitcoin mining. Bitcoin mining is the process of turning computing power into actual Bitcoins. It allows you to generate Bitcoins without the need to actually buy them. Now a lot of people would say that mining cannot be done at home because you need very expensive equipment in order to start mining. This is not entirely true. Any computer can be used to mine Bitcoins, even the oldest and the weakest laptop you have lying around at home. Actually not too long ago a successful experiment was made wherein a 55 year old IBM computer was used to mine Bitcoins. Anyway, whenever you start looking for guides on how to mine Bitcoins it\u2019s always very technical with terms like \u201chash-rate\u201d and \u201cSHA-256\u201d and all sorts of other weird stuff. So you find yourself struggling with these terms until you finally just give up on the notion of mining Bitcoins all together and, you know, just move on. Now the good news is that you can mine bitcoins at home, using any computer you have lying around in a simple and easy process. The only thing that you need is just a computer with internet access of course and personally I\u2019d suggest using a computer that is not doing anything else because once you start doing this it\u2019s going to be pretty demanding on the computer and it\u2019s going to slow it down substantially. So first, go to www.Bitminter.com. On the nav bar select \u201cJoin\u201d and create an account. Make sure to remember your username as you will be using this in the following steps. Then go to \u201ctools\u201d, \u201cBitminter client\u201d and choose \u201clatest update\u201d. This will download a file to your computer so you can start mining Bitcoins. Once the file has finished downloading just run it and follow the simple installation instructions. It doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re on a Mac, Windows or Linux computer, the program will run smoothly on any operating system, you just need to make sure you have Java installed. If you don\u2019t, the program will ask that you install it once you run it. Once the program is up click \u201cEngine start\u201d, enter your username and Voil\u00e0! You are now mining Bitcoins from your home computer. A few important things before we conclude. Make sure to keep your computer cooled down using a fan or a dedicated cooling device because if you don\u2019t it may overheat and damage itself. You\u2019ll also notice that if you mine on your home computer, you\u2019re probably mining very slow and won\u2019t get enough Bitcoins to even cover the electricity cost of running the computer. For example, on my computer, I made about 13 satoshis after a full day of mining. If you want to calculate how many Bitcoins you can mine on your own computer, just use a mining calculator and enter your processing speed. You can see your processing speed at the bottom right side of the Bitminter program. If you want to increase your mining rate, you can always attach dedicated bitcoin miners to your home computer. Today\u2019s Bitcoin miners are known as ASIC miners. ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit and it\u2019s basically an ultra-powerful computer designed for just mining Bitcoins. You can find many used miners on eBay or you can just buy one online. To sum things up, you can still mine bitcoins at home using any old computer. You\u2019re not going to be very efficient but if you want to get a taste of what it means like to be a Bitcoin miner, you can do so in just 2 minutes using the technique we just discussed. If this video helped you out, I'd appreciate you liking it, tweeting about it or sharing it on Facebook. I'll see you in the next video.",

            "transcript": "  hello guys and welcome to Martin Jackson today we will talk about base Bitcoin mining sites and actually this will be kind of my best VidCon mining sites and maybe for user are different Bitcoin mining sites which you think that they are best for you but this will we will talk about cloud mining especially and not like we are using our hardware our own but we are using someone else or we are buying someone else's hardware to actually mined Bitcoin and as you see now guys if we go here into coin market cup we can see that Bitcoin has gone and it has reached its all high as you see it's already eight thousand six hundred and that's why I'm considering and in my last one of my last videos I create a bit about Bitcoin mining and there I showed you beat Club actually as you remember this one site and many of you asked me to show some cheaper options because to join peaceful you need to pay hundred dollars and this is actually one of my best as well Bitcoin mining sites which I have joined but here you have to wait 30 days and and now I'm waiting my 30 days until they will set up because I bought this cheapest pool and I don't really know how much I will start earning from this one but I am waiting and when I when it will start I will let you know guys what is going on here with Bitcoin Club and next one was you know it is Genesis mining but here you never can get cash power but that has power which is available this is it it doesn't pay back to mines those other coins only Bitcoin mining here pays back but guys to wait so long I don't want to wait so long so today we will show you another Bitcoin mining website which is cloud mining which I have researched for myself and you can decide whether to invest or not invest and as you know girls in all my videos I do a short disclaimer because I am showing only those websites where I am investing myself and you can decide whether you want to invest or not it depends on you guys because we all have our own heads and this is in this channel on Martyn's hacks I am only showing my in so unless you know guys who already worked with me I invest in hexapod this is great investment and this is chain group another one yesterday as you see a $60 from two and a half thousand almost and I reinvested them back as you know I'm compounding and going up here $200 then I'm investing in extra corn and as you remember yesterday we were transferring or I was transferring this money to hex truck oil to from $650 and now my investment is nine hundred and sixty dollars and everything works fine here as well and today like I said I'm going to show you this one which is was X and I invested in this as you see 0.02 Bitcoin if we go copy this and we will go to calculator you can see I already was calculating today's price is hundred and seventy two dollars 0.02 Bitcoin cost hundred and seventy dollars yesterday or two days before I was investing I don't really remember I'm investing in so many things like and I found this website I researched it and I found a decent that's why I invested and I already made the profits which I will show you as well in second guys and here as you see I invested about hundred and fifty dollars I believe it was yes because I'm investing in many sites but I forgot to show you this one which is was X and this was this is my first investment and I bought 400 as you see for 0.02 Bitcoin net here you can pretty much buy how much you want like as you see one Giga hash cost zero point zero zero zero four zero zero zero Bitcoin and I bought for 0.02 and I bought four hundred and nineteen nine bigger hashes and now I will show you how much I made with these already my investment and what is happening here in was X goes actually it is pretty much you are buying a software and good thing about this is that here is online comer and you can see that software alive as you see here you click play and you can see this software life how its mining and you are investing in this POSIX software and that's I found this kind of decent and less easy so this mining equipment it's live and they're changing dates here all the time like every single days they are changing this date so guys I need to shut this down and now let's go and I will show you my profits as you see guys I already have earned zero point zero zero one nine nine six zero Bitcoin and it happened I believe it's only in one day because I bought this particular 499 be cash is two days ago we go to basic as you see I have four hundred ninety 90 caches and if what you are doing pretty much you are investing in that software in that mining software and you are getting your funds back and as you see my total profit from already in one day I would say is this one and if we go back not Bitcoin calculator let's have a look oh my child I earned almost $2 guys as you see from investment hundred and fifty dollars I already made back almost two dollars in one day guys and I believe it's a good investment because Bitcoin price is going high now and I want to mine Bitcoin I want to get as much Bitcoin as I can and store it in my wallet that's why I'm joining these mining sites as well not only concentrating on these investment platforms as you know where I am investing so yes guys if you found this video useful and actually I believe a link under this video if you want to join this website you can come and look and there is no membership fees like we this one bit Club network which I showed you and you were many of you were unhappy and that you have to pay membership hundred dollars before you can even start mining and yes guys if you want you can try this one out but like I always say in all of my videos guys it's up to you to make all these investments and if you found this video useful leave a like share this video subscribe to my channel if you are new and see you in my other videos",

            "transcript": "  [Music] hey what's up guys Steven here welcome back to another video so the last video about bitcoins is literally exploding right now and I did see in the comments that a lot of you guys are interested on having a look behind the scenes of a mining farm and we did it we visited hydro miner in a tiny village won our way from Vienna and they also still have their ICO running so you can find all the information down below in the description but now I would say let's jump right in now we all know that Bitcoin a crypto mining is real and not a scam but mining those coins is actually harder than a lot of people think and it consumes enormous amounts of electricity so they're currently building a few of the new mining containers and we had to look at one of them which hosts over a thousand graphic cards hydro miners based in Austria which is known for not having the cheapest electricity cost in the world but still they are very successful so we asked them how they do it so we are mining company based in Austria and remain cryptocurrencies we offer Bitcoin mining and ether mining various Alcorn's and we can achieve this really low energy price which is really important if you want to become competitive through placing containers with mining Hardware directly into a hydropower stations so we don't have the high Network costs and we remind with only renewable energy so so that's our unique selling point and through this low energy price we have a really competitive mining operation and yeah I've seen a lot of good feedback so far so other cloud mining services offer cash rates and we base our our service on what so it's it's it's a more stable outcome because I'm doing the first month a hash rate is fine you know you get high returns but then in the end you get a lot less - - nothing at the last month so we base it on what so there's a stable outcome and I mean it guarantees you a profitable so I started like that you can you could whole mind a few years ago but right now it's not it's not competitive anymore I mean in Germany for example you have to pay up to 30 cents per kilowatt I mean we have we have it here around three to five cent in Austria in the hydro power stations but you just can't compete with the big players anymore because the it's there are big players and you have to join a big operation to to really make profit mining so so yeah we think the cloud mining is a good thing there was a lot of scam or there is a lot of scamming going on you should really check the cloud mining facilities carefully and see if there's really hardware in the facilities because yeah it's sometimes people lose their money but we provide full transparency and we want we offer guy to choose and we want the people to see that we are actually a operation that works and makes profit so that's the thing about the risk of all cloud mining but yeah you have to do you at you JIT your diligence and and and you can make a good profit from it so they told us that they have a few of those containers full with mining equipment and I know most of you guys are really pissed because the availability of cheapy use is now a huge problem and also some cheap use get way more expensive there our CTO told us that they can order up to 20,000 GPUs directly from China each month and there are huge numbers they are using cards before they get branded so some of them come without fans or have different coolers installed and they come directly from the factory which then delivers it to brands like sell tag so if a lot of mining companies buy huge numbers of GPUs then for sure the price for the GPUs Rises a lot which is the problem but GPUs are not everything there is actually a lot of hardware knowledge and quiet to get such a container up and running there our CTO Christian answered us some technical questions about the container the important factor of course is the cheap energy and you have also have to a cool requirement and of course a space where I can place your containers or your mining rigs for now we have about zero point twenty mega hash per watt and one week of those can do 185 about mega hash it cerium and in dual mining we see a coin you can reach 1850 mega ashes see a coin we decide with the help from some other websites like what to mine and compare the coins and we are mining it Syria material plastic see echo and decreed set cash a lot of coins and we are switching all the time yeah Bitcoin - of course with our asset - we have about 50 Giga it's here in power and factor 10 see a coin you can compare like this because a lot of coins was mega hash the total power usage is about 350 kilowatts now in the operation completed about 3000 cards for now and over 300 are sick - shipping container of course we have 144 ready - in here with a TPU so 1152 GPUs inside yes and one container about 30 kike hash etherium and 300 Giga has see a coin power usage from one container is about 150 kilowatt all right so many GPU means a lot of hashing power a lot of energy consumption but also a lot of money so let's talk numbers The Container we're looking at has 1152 GPUs inside with a mining power of 30 Kekaha shovey theorem and consumes 150,000 watts so if we put that in our calculator that gives us roughly 30 K dollars a month after the electricity costs so that's really not bad at all but what about the electricity now basically those machines generate a virtual so-called currency that's maybe not even worth anything and will consume as much power Stenmark by 2020 well allowing that Bitcoin will replace banks ATMs brokers exchanges and payment services like MasterCard and people all around the world we can offset the electricity required by all those services and you have to keep in mind that the combined electricity cost of those services may even exceed Denmark's current power usage right now although some power plants like solar and wind plants sometimes nearly overload its electric grid over a particularly sunny and windy day and then power companies pay their customers to use more power so that the energy could be safely dispersed so this excessive energy could be used to mined bitcoins and the heat which the miners produce could be used to heat water so there are many attempts that will be discussed once the greedy let's make a quick profit face of Bitcoin is over so as you can see mining scaled a lot in past years from home computers Mining under GPU to fully loaded containers placed near to power plants mining at home is still possible but you need to have access to cheap electricity and need to have free extra space and don't care about a lot of noise from those machines so if you're more interested you can check out all the links down below in the description all right guys so we're now here at the end of this video and if you liked it please like it if you have any questions about mining or anything Bitcoin related post it down below in the comments and I'll try to reply as soon as possible also if you want to stay tuned about more video then please hit the subscribe button right now i'm steven from tech magnet and i'll catch you in the next one have a nice day",

            "transcript": "  my mind Bitcoin for seven days 24 hours a day straight and I want to show you how much money I made now before I get started and before I show you my Bitcoin wallet I just want to say if you don't know what bitcoin is and you're interested in learning how to mind Bitcoin go ahead and click on this video here this is a video I made called Bitcoin for beginners it will just briefly explain what bitcoin is and how you can mine bitcoin and make money mining it while you sleep so let's just get straight to it I mind a Bitcoin for seven days straight 24 hours a day now I'll admit I did run into some hiccups my computer crashed once I lost about eight hours I had to use my computer and stop mining just for a little bit so I lost I'd say about 15 hours of mining in that one week but other than that I had my computer running non-stop mining Bitcoin so I'm going to show you my Bitcoin wallet and how much money I made so here's my Bitcoin wallet in one week running almost 24 hours a day I was able to make drumroll please just over $3 now wait you might say that's it that doesn't even cover the electric bill well you're right it doesn't I most definitely lost money this week on electricity I'm going to have to pay probably quite a bit because my computer is on full tilt the entire time but the point is is that you can make money now while I only made $3 some people out there are making tens of thousands of dollars and now it depends on how fast your computer is and how fast your graphics cards are now if you're not sure how fast your graphics card is here's a really good resource that you can use to check ATI Radeon graphics cards it'll show you the model here and how many mega hashes per second that graphics card gets now once you figure out this mega hash per second it's pretty easy all you need to do is use a Bitcoin calculator you can put in your mega hash per second how much wattage your computer uses the cost of a kilowatt per hour and you can get that number either on your power bill or you can just simply Google what is the cost per kilowatt hour where you live and you can put in how much you spend on your computer let's say you bought a few new graphics cards too to help mine and get this mega hash number as high as possible and how how long you want do this so right now it's set for 90 days press calculate and you can see the numbers down here at the bottom 24 hours 1 month 1 year 90 days and so this is a really cool tool once you get all that information so that's really it I just wanted to share with you my Bitcoin experience now mind you a Bitcoin today is worth a hundred and sixteen dollars so this is really just over three dollars but if a Bitcoin were to all of a sudden be worth $200 this is now worth six dollars so this number will change based on the value of a Bitcoin but anyways after one week of mining Bitcoin I was able to earn just over three dollars and just for those of you who are wondering my mega hash per second was a hundred and thirty so that'll give you an idea of of what I'm working with and what you're working with so like I said before if you're interested in learning how to mine Bitcoin go ahead and click on this link right here and that will redirect you to a video I made that will show you how to set up a miner so that's it thanks for watching and good luck",

            "title": "Life Inside a Secret Chinese Bitcoin Mine",
            "transcript": " Bitcoin and other cryptos are the future to which we are heading.  With them, our life would be so lighter.  LIFE IN THE CHINESE BITCOIN DOLE  The isolation in the rural area of \u200b\u200bnortheast China is located  six mines on bitcoons that belong to a mysterious group of four people.  By October 2014, they generated 4,050 bitcoins per month, about 36 million crowns.  Their computing power is equivalent to 3% of the entire BitTorrent network.  We head to Changcheng, one of our bitcoin farms.  Dalilan has a special place in the bituminous industry due to the environment.  Air quality and conditions are quite good.  Conditions in other mining towns are quite harsh.  The life of miners is quite dull.  We look at the best bitter mine in Changcheng.  It is a three-storey building. We have the second floor.  I am the general manager of this mining site.  I'm in charge of the operative.  This includes equipment, staff and supply of electricity.  Me and my friends have created this project together.  We are all shareholders.  We put the money together and solve the problems together.  We currently have 6 downs.  We are doing our best to open more mines.  We race to respond to demand on the Internet.  Whoever has a great performance will be rewarded.  Rewards are bitcoins, a virtual currency.  In the best times, we mined up to 100 bitcoins a day in each mine.  As the demand and computing power increase, the numbers change.  Electricity costs are also associated with this.  We use about 1,250 kWh.  Our electricity bill is around 2 million crowns per month.  At this scale and with this equipment, we will earn 20 to 25 bitcoins each day.  We have about 3,000 miners here.  Everything starts with the connection of mining machines to power.  Then connect them to the Internet.  Once miners are online, computers can change their settings.  Then they can create algorithms.  When the right calculation is done, we get a reward.  I believe Bitcoins will be the currency of the future.  They can not completely replace the current financial system,  but the financial system goes in this direction.  Bitcoin value is not stable because we are still at the beginning of development.  Honestly, it's still a stage of mining.  It is similar to China's transition from cash  on the use of credit and debit cards.  We believe in them because they are the trend of this era.  This is one of the periods that a financial company must have  to go through your development.  Right now, the Chinese government neither supports nor opposes us.  If the bitcoin market operates safely and legally,  I think the Chinese government will continue to support in the future.  These machines are either broken or no longer used.  There are about 900.  Because Avalond consumes more electricity  and has lower performance, it is a product that should disappear from the market.  Our machines have higher performance.  We recycle everything we can and give them a new purpose.  The remainder can only be disposed of as waste.  The fans must work, otherwise the temperature would be too high.  When machines overheat, it collapses.  You see the fans yourself.  When something goes wrong,  performance drops  and the miners' back turns red.  We also have large suction fans here.  There are twelve of them.  When you walk into the room, you feel a great gust of wind.  For heat dissipation it works great.  When they are running at full power, they could get somebody in.  It tastes good, is not it?  Tasteless?  Soak it in a sauce.  Most employees live right here.  Compared to the same positions in traditional industry  our employees have relatively high salaries.  Once the machine starts, it can not stop due to a human error.  Common problems include electricity,  with the power supply, the internet, or the computers themselves.  These things directly affect the profits from our mines.  The main qualification of our employees is knowledge of computers.  They have to understand them really well.  We will learn the other abilities associated with Bitcoin after admission.  This is a rest room.  Employee life is simple, perhaps a little boring.  In addition to monitoring devices, workers are asleep,  read or play with mobile phones.  Because we are working 24 hours a day,  we need somebody here for security.  So when employees have a service,  they must also be available at night.  The problem of which  I'm most afraid is a massive system failure.  Let's say I have 1,000 machines and 200 of them will fall.  I will have to find out where the error occurred.  Most problems can easily be solved.  The workload is also not too great.  I can drink tea or coffee while I watch the machines.  I listen to audiobooks and play games, drink water, smoke ...  When I'm tired, I'm over and relaxing.  At first I was not very excited.  But now I think it's great.  How many of your assets are Bitcoins?  At this point it's about 50%.  Another 50% is cash.  Do you think it's a good time to invest in Bitcoins?  I think so. ",

            "transcript": "  Bitcoin mining he's probably been hearing about this everywhere especially given the barren wasteland that is trying to find any decent AMD GPU for sale new or even used I did a quick fun video a few days ago about how I use the mining ring to keep my room and a few of you were interested in me doing a beginner's guide to get started with mining so here is said video a lot of stress that this is strictly a beginner slash noob guide to mining and it won't be diving into anything too complex like flashing bios's under volting or manipulating your GPU in any way let me know though if you're interested in such a video down below in the comments but for this video we're going to stick to the basics let me give you some background on mining Before we jump into the how you do it portion I'll do my best to keep this brief and simple but that will mean I'm sacrificing nuance for ease here the goal isn't to get you to understand how everything works just a general idea of what you'll be messing with so while the world is discussing Bitcoin mining that's actually a bit of a misnomer bitcoin has become a catch-all phrase for most types of crypto currencies kind of how like a hook and loop strap is known as velcro or gelatin is known as jello or tissues are known as Kleenex there's various types of crypto currencies even if they get referred to as the generic trademark of Bitcoin so when you see everyone using their arcs 480 or 5 80s for mining they're likely not mining Bitcoin exactly but a Bitcoin alternative known as alt coin there's a bunch of different types of allah coins such as light coin dogecoin z cash and the most popular one for mining at this point aetherium okay so with that out of the way here's the super rough not entirely accurate broad understanding of how you mind for these currencies essentially you take your computer flip on a program and that program uses your computer's horsepower to validate certain metrics in a data set and then based on how much data you process you in return get paid for your services again not entirely correct by the simple picture the closest thing I could compare it to is like folding at home you dedicate your hardware to help process information with regards to protein folding with distributed computing but instead of helping save lives you make money well you don't exactly make money you earn the cryptocurrency Bitcoin aetherium whatever and because other individuals have determined that those crypto currencies can be used to make a transaction there's monetary value attached to the jeez I've already poorly explained cryptocurrency mining and now I'm giving you a crippled understanding of fiat currencies anyways summation you give the cloud your GPU they give you currency you sell the currency for cash okay forget me trying to explain things now it's time to move on to how to actually do it there's a thousand different ways to set up a miner but I'm going to go over one of the most popular ways and then also show you some of the limitations of it the incredibly simple ways to download nice hash miner from the website in the video description and just run the program the few things you'll need to get started are your computer obviously but then also a Bitcoin address which is essentially where nice hash should deposit the currency that you earn how do you get a Bitcoin address well you need a wallet which is principally where you're going to store your cryptocurrency there are a thousand different wallets you can set up online but I keep mine with a Bitcoin exchange as that allows me to transfer the cryptocurrency into dollars in my american bank account through your own research on where it's best for you to store the currency whether that be in a dedicated wallet or if you just plan on hoarding your coins or in an exchange because you want to trade it within to your local currency I'll put some links in the video description to help you guys make that decision wherever you end up storing your coins it'll generate the address that you need to put into the nice hash miner in order to start earning once you have that address here's the super simple part the miner automatically detects which Hardware you have you click on benchmark and the program will check your hardware against roughly ten or so different types of actual cryptocurrency miners to see how well your PC performs once the benchmarking is done and you start the actual mining nice hash will run the miners for you and also switch to whichever type of currency might be most profitable for your system to be mining at any given time the nice hash miner converts whatever currency remaining directly into Bitcoin and will only deposit Bitcoin to your account you can set the program up to do a whole host of things like only mine once it reaches a certain profitability level or run when the computer is idle so it will turn on whenever you've stopped using your PC which is a nice feature if you're forgetful about turning this kind of stuff on which I know I am super simple super easy you click start and you're off to the races earning money using your PC hardware for distributed however with anything that's simple there's nuance that's left out that you may or may not want to know for example nice hash only pays out in Bitcoin which may not be your preferred currency to keep also pay out times vary from either every day or once a week depending on how much Bitcoin you actually mine which could be too infrequent or too soon depending on how you want to be paid however overall if you just want to set it and forget it option nice hash is a superb program for that I keep it running on all the computers in my office and I'm currently earning in the neighborhood of like 30 to 35 dollars per day depending on the given exchange rate which comes out to a thousand dollars a month at the current exchange rate which isn't too bad however if you don't want the simple way you can run the individual miners yourself by downloading them and setting them up I'll be in a less user friendly manner if you want to make sure you're only ever mining one specific altcoin or you prefer different payment structures or you just want more control over what each program is doing but then you also have to get into the idea of mining pools which I'll include a link in the video description for but I'm not going to address that here this all sounds really great and almost too good to be true you use your electricity and your PC to generate cash where's the catch well it's in several places so let's spend the time to talk about that the most obvious is that you have to make sure that the cost you're spending on electricity is less than the value of what you're mining in the currency otherwise you're upside-down and just spending more money on electricity then you're getting back you can definitely choose to do that if you think that the value of the coins in the future will be worth the cost that you're putting into it right now but that's a gamble so I personally only mind if the profit from the currencies exceeds my electricity costs so with that let's take a look at the GPUs I currently have on hand the gtx 1060 GT x 1080 with updated memory and RX 480 and 2rx 580 s1 with 4 gigabytes of vram and one with 8 gigabytes let's take them and throw them at noise hashes profitability calculator and determine their value this is just going to be a quick and dirty calculation not going into nuance just using the data that nice hash themselves provide to us for any of the GPUs that I mentioned based on the speculated cost and amount of dollars per day you can earn with the cards the time to pay off each dpu is between 57 days and 91 days depending on what your card you're talking about or 2 to 3 months and that's even with taking the normal cost of electricity in consideration not too shabby definitely seems worth it however while this is a super helpful chart to determine current profitability of the GPUs that's basically all it does and that's a big problem if you're looking to invest into mining right now what do you mean by big problem Brett I'm glad you asked Internet person there are two major variables that these calculators typically don't take into account because they're super difficult to predict those are the future price of the currency and the difficulty increases with mining the price fluctuation should be an obvious idea to everyone the market determines the value of the currency which varies wildly on any given day last week Bitcoin peaked at $3,000 per coin but then straight up plummeted closer to the $2,000 region shortly after but is now again in the mid 2000s that's some straight-up scary volatility if you ask me a lot of people are agreeing right now that the price of cryptocurrency is basically inflated due to a speculative bubble which means it could end these prices high prices at any moment and bring everyone back to an unprofitable mining status or much less profitable mining status although that's again entirely speculation and not a guarantee the prices are hard to now the second factor that I mentioned is the difficulty of the mining itself as more and more people come in and start doing these distributed computing calculations the difficulty of the calculations increase and your current hardware isn't able to get as much of the share due to it now being slower in terms of the hash rate this difficulty change is inevitable and it isn't something that's easy to predict as the scene of mining is changing so rapidly however there are some basic calculators that you can use that take a generic difficult to increase into account and shows you what profits will be going out the overall profits from each TV you aren't as high as you would expect even two years later and for some based on the guesswork of the difficulty increase will actually start to cost you money even less than one year out obviously the nice hash program can get you around this because it switches to mine the most profitable currencies and you can set it to only mine at a certain profitability level but it's something to definitely should be keeping in mind then there's the other issue that the amount of VRAM on certain GPUs likely won't be enough going forward especially if you're mining a cerium the dag file directed acyclic graph associated with mining a cerium gets larger all the time currently it's on pace to start affecting four gigabyte GPUs in the near future and their ability to mine which obviously can't be accounted for in current profitability charts but may make all those four gig AMD GPUs harder to pay off which doesn't even take into account the chances of aetherium going proof a steak instead of proof of work but that's an entirely different conversation altogether so with difficulty increases in price fluctuations and the fact that poor gigabyte cards may or may not be enough depending on the currency your mining it's actually really tough to predict what the exact time of return on investment will be for your GPU setup if the bubble burst and prices crashed the ROI could be measured in months or years rather than days or it wouldn't be worth it at all because the cost of electricity will outpace the return of value in the currency this isn't to say don't mind far from it actually I just wanted to make this video to Requip you with the basic knowledge to get into mining and then also to keep an eye out for the impending changes that could cost you if you decide to spend a lot of money on a mining right now but on the flip side the prices can continue to go up you make a return on the hardware that you bought before it becomes unprofitable and you win and all of my negative speculation isn't worth anything however my current plan is to just run the hardware that I have on hand until the cost of electricity outpaces the profit that I make the speculative bubble just seems too risky for my tastes and I'd rather buy up the GPUs that everyone is selling dirt-cheap once everything crashes rather than to try and get in right at this moment but I'll be including all the resources that I mentioned in this video as well as a few others in the video description down below to help you guys out and make these decisions for yourself there's definitely value in getting into cryptocurrency mining right now for many people however it could just as quickly hurt you if you invest expecting to make a quick return and things go steps my aim isn't to tell you what to do but rather give you information to determine what you want to do but to save this video from getting too long I'm going to end it there I'm keen to hear what you guys have in terms of hardware and is profitable for mining altcoins or if you're planning on getting into the mining game right now and buying the hardware to do so tell me all about it in the comments down below let's have a conversation down there also be sure to hit the like button if you found this video helpful at all subscribe if you're new around here and want to stay up-to-date on my tech related content and I'll see you guys in the next video Cheers [Music]",

            "transcript": "  huzi go muffled freedom fighters in today's video we're gonna go over bitcoin mining for beginners [Music] alright guys so let's talk about Bitcoin now Bitcoin has been getting a lot of hype lately and people are getting really excited because if you look at this and you go to coin market Capcom you could literally see the prices fluctuating to the point where they're probably going to bounce back once again you know what's not gonna be too long until we see another $20,000 worth Bitcoin $30,000 worth pickle and even some say if it's gonna get up to $40,000 by this summer time so you know you really need to find a way to start increasing your position and just collecting more bitcoins that's literally the name of the game it's collecting bitcoins and there's many different ways one of the best ways is of course getting a position when prices are low and stuff like that but another way is Bitcoin mining now usually normally what happens is you would have to go and get like a bunch of computers and they'll take a lot of power and a lot of electricity - liddie like mine the Bitcoin from the internet and it was not usually very cost effective for most people depending on the location they have depending on the resources they have that's right for most people you know they don't really want to get in a Bitcoin mining because of the fact that it is so hard I mean look how complicated some of these rigs are of just trying to get some bitcoins just mines and Bitcoin from the internet right but what I personally do is I use shared services or cloud services like Hasler which you've yet in the link in the description where you know I've been actively invested I literally started like a week ago and this is just me documenting my journey and what happens and this is usually pegged to the price of the USD - Bitcoin but you know I'm very optimistic on the growth of the bit code so I know literally that this is just going to two three four five acts in return as the prices of Bitcoin increases okay so literally like I said I started this like last week and I just wanted to test it out to see if it worked so I can show you guys if it worked or not for me right so you know if you this is for you or not for you and obviously you know it's been doing pretty well and I didn't really put in that much I think I put in like three thousand and I'm already getting like around a 30% returning my investment on a monthly basis which is insane because you know like I said if I just put that in an index fund it would only be like 10% within the you okay so today we're just probably going to reinvest what I have in here on the balance from what I've made from just you know the daily Bitcoin mining that I've been making and you know it's really excited because the thing about this right is the name of the game is you want to increase your position in Bitcoin you want to literally collect as much of Bitcoin as possible because it's literally like a video game right and like I said I do that by buying on the lows but I also do that by Bitcoin mining so that I make you know Bitcoin on a daily basis and like I said the money that I make from this I'm probably going to actively reinvest it back into the platform so that in mines more Bitcoin for me because what it is you know is it's like a company where they basically own all of these rigs and I'm basically renting out their equipment like right over here I'll probably rent out like like a small area of this space where you know this is dedicated to my Bitcoin for me personally okay so what we're gonna do we're just gonna upgrade it and it's very simple all I gotta do is I gotta go to buy house right I'm gonna shot 256 because that's like the very popular one and we're just gonna click on that and we'll just do the balance that's in there right now let's see let's go over to like point oh five Bitcoin 0.05 for two Bitcoin okay so around seven under $26 and let's select a payment method we're gonna pay with the balance I confirm confirm purchase what successful enjoy so now you know I'll have like 17.9 terraces so let's actually do the math in the Bitcoin mining calculator that is about 17 9 so it's about that much and then take that out take that out charges around 20% fees so after I initially break-even right after all of this what's gonna happen is it's going to start making me you know thirty dollars a day well like I said this is pegged to the Bitcoin so now bitcoin is only what is this it is around thirteen thousand dollars USD but as he keeps on going you know this is also going to multiply as well for what it is that I have invested so that's pretty exciting because like I said on a daily basis I'm making Bitcoin right on whatever these are low you know I'm also making Bitcoin when I when I like ride the swings up and that's kind of like the exciting thing for this platform so that's like said Hassler that's pretty exciting get it in the link in the description if you want to also start creating your journey in mining Bitcoin well let's actually take a look at the market right because now we're actually getting like a general upswing you know we're seeing like a more bullish market now and I'm pretty excited because I took several positions in certain coins that are actually moving upwards so let's actually copy this and put that in there so you guys can see the graph cool so let me tell you guys actively what I'm taking like an active position like I said I'll do Bitcoin mining right and tomorrow this will update and this will make Bitcoin for me on a daily basis but what I also like doing is whenever I buy on the Lowe's right and I basically ride the swings up I basically take some of the profits that I make and I'll put it into various other all cones so like I said I literally just started my journey I'm really freaking excited because I've learned so much in the past two weeks week and a half and I surround myself with the mentors that I have here in Chiangmai so it's really exciting because I'm learning this with you guys right I'm learning this with you guys and you can see I'm a normal average person that's getting this that's already seeing some gains and like I said if I could learn something like Bitcoin when I was all just gung-ho on Shopify affiliate marketing blogging in YouTube right anyone can do this man that's why I literally don't overcomplicate things if I can figure it out you can figure out as well and I'm going to tell you what I took positions in and why so that you can maybe start doing the exact same thing as well okay guys so I took like the name the game is to collect Bitcoin write the name of the game is to collect Bitcoin and if you ever invest in any of these of course the end goal is to take the profits and you either pay it out in either aetherium or Bitcoin and like said bitcoin is the game right you literally want to collect as much before you know the last Bitcoin is mine so of course I always take positions in Bitcoin whenever it's low you never want to get it when it's at the highest you know I bought it right here if you saw the previous videos and I basically just started riding it right and another thing that I took a big position in was I think I bought it around here and it's really cool because it's up 16% so I'm pretty excited so like I literally made sixteen percent of the money that was inside there within the past 24 hours and for those who don't know what aetherium is it's basically what you use to buy all these other alt coins down here okay yeah you can use a Bitcoin but if you want to get into like some like exchanges or if you're doing like icos or stuff like that which we could talk about later on I you generally get aetherium to participate in these icos which one is that it like I'm not a financial advisor you should do your own researches icos or like any type of altcoin investing or just cryptocurrency is risky do your own homework this is a disclaimer I'm just basically telling you this from my experience yes so I have like a good position in Bitcoin and aetherium and also I put in a decent amount of money into icon around this dip right here on this dip I actually put in a decent sized investment like a set of the money that I was willing to lose from my main businesses and I'm pretty excited because like I said it went up 26 percent in the past 24 hours so I definitely made some good profits in there and for those that want to know well like Icahn is because like I said a lot of people that are starting into this they're just used to like Bitcoin and then they hear about a theory I'm like oh my god what's aetherium well it's pretty exciting because not where we're in in this situation is back in the day you know when people when big companies like Facebook like Apple like I'm Twitter like when they had their IPO and they went public right you know the people that made the most money were the early investors but for most normal people you know it's hard to be an investor because you you have to know the right people right but the thing about this you know everything is decentralized you have YouTube platforms that are literally sharing what it is that they're making money with and you know it's literally the biggest transfer of wealth the biggest opportunity of our lifetime that we have ever experienced seriously since the age of the internet when it first started so what this is basically is like if you invest in like companies like icon right it's you like investing in the IPO stages of these companies and like I said I didn't get into the IPO sage is called an ICM i friended he got this at 11 cents so he literally got a huge return on his investment imagine this 11 cents so for every 11 cents do the math I think that's like 50 60 X at this point yeah that's basically what it is so he basically 60 X his initial investment right so I bought it maybe around like $5 so like I said I I only got like a 26% but he like 506 out of the math I'm not I'm really bad at math you made a lot of money from investing in this in the IPO stage or the ico stage of this company but like I said there's still a lot of growth and this is why you want to do your own research because you want to see if there's even further potential the reason why I saw it is like if I if you look at the website by the way let's actually check this out like said I would do your own research you could join their telegram group and read the white paper but what I got really excited about is if you see this right what you'll see is like this is a Korean coin basically to what I've researched and what they're trying to do is to hyper connect the world and the reason why I'm really excited with this and why I can still think this could jump to $10 to $15 maybe even a $20 in the future and I'll probably like 3x or 4x my money which is crazy because like my friend like literally a hundred two hundred X's money that's why you literally want to do your research find these coins earlier on so you could get a higher multiple is because if you look at Bitcoin and this is why I'm really excited you know you look at Bitcoin for most markets that they're spending around thirteen to fourteen thousand dollars for one Bitcoin right and like I said you don't have to buy a full Bitcoin you could literally go and what's called buy by fractions of Bitcoin but if you look at the Korean exchange which is bit thumb you know for a single Bitcoin it's seventeen thousand dollars so the creative market they're literally paying a premium for Bitcoin and they are active consumers in purchasing in the crypto currency so when this starts getting I'm not sure if this um if what's it called icons on bit them yet but when it does you know I truly believe it's going to have a crazy multiple on the current price so let's actually see if it say no so right now it's only on by nets okay and these are the exchanges that you could trade in and the way you do it is you either buy Bitcoin or aetherium and then you transfer that money into those exchanges like by nice guys so that's really yet that's kind of like an update of my hash store account like I said if you want to start mining Bitcoin so not only are you making money from trading it and holding it which is what I do that's like my long-term thing I leave buy things a hold I don't do swing training but if you also want to make some Bitcoin on a daily basis right even though it's like a little like I said it's a compounding effect and only start with what you're comfortable with losing because I said this is really risky but you know it's really exciting man get it in the link in the description but understand we are in a position where there's just a crazy change of wealth because of the fact that now normal people have the opportunity to take part in these companies that are literally changing the world that are hyper connecting the world and it's really cool because like I said you know in business you want you start off as an employee then you start off doing your own business then like what Robert Kiyosaki says you move over to the investing stage so if you're making money from job shipping or affiliate marketing area if you have some extra income from the side or from Christmas or whatnot instead of blowing it on a dumb stuff literally put it in things that are increasing your net worth and right now cryptocurrency is boomin cryptocurrency is hot and you need to find a way to get a piece of the action right now guys so hopefully this helps if you like this make sure you smash the subscribe button and hit the notification bell so you get notified for all the new videos when I release them and for everyone else I will see you guys on my blog day TDI's peace out",

            "transcript": "  [Music] what is up ladies and gentlemen and welcome back to another video from the tech cash house today hope all of you are having a good one now in today's video I'll actually be discussing something that I haven't covered for quite a while and that is in fact Bitcoin mining profitability now these videos used to be quite popular when I would make them but mining was relatively consistent for a while so I figured you know there was no real reason to examine the profitability for the past couple of months or so however the condition of Bitcoin with mining difficulty has definitely changed recently so in this video I'll go ahead and jump right into that explain to all of you if Bitcoin mining is profitable or not we'll be comparing five different miners kind of lining them up and seeing how exactly they compare and there are a couple of things that I want all of you to keep in mind when you are actually watching this video so first things first this is for mining right now this is not for mining in the future this is for mining in the month of August of 2018 so it's very topical for the current time period second Bitcoin prices change constantly so keep that in third for all of these tests I've set the power cost to ten cents per kilowatt hour that is actually slightly lower than the United States average but power cost in the United States tend to be a bit higher than other remote areas of some nations so we'll be leaving it at ten cents per kilowatt hour Bitcoin mining difficulty increases that's the next thing I want all of you to keep in mind mining actually becomes more difficult over time not exponentially so at this rate but it does increase in so fifth Bitcoin miner prices change and many people price gouge miners so you may not be getting a good deal if you buy a miner at the current time however because demand has slowed down a I wouldn't expect miners to be too overpriced right now six the Bitcoin miners generate heat and noise if your mining in a small space I might just encourage you not to unless your prospects are very profitable or you pay almost nothing for power still if you're in a dorm room it's generally illud to mine and you'll probably be pretty uncomfortable so seventh Bitcoin mining can use power from solar panels or wind turbines to increase profitability now I'm sure not all of you have these accessible to you but if you do you can definitely cut down on costs so number eight a Bitcoin could be worth 100 grand in a year or $20 future price is really impossible to determine definitively and for that reason I would keep an open mind when it comes to bitcoins fluctuating price obviously if you're holding your coins in the value of Bitcoin increases you will definitely be making more money so number 9 mind bitcoin can be taxed and will be taxed as income number 10 Bitcoin miners generally depreciate in value so if you're buying one and you fear that it may be overpriced try to find a better deal elsewhere and with that being said folks let's go ahead and jump right into the comparison so first we have the amp miner S 5 now the S 5 obviously isn't an incredibly powerful miner however it isn't all that expensive and I think that could make it pretty darn attractive for a lot of people interested so it has a hash rate of 1000 Giga hashes per second and not too bad it has a power draw of 560 watts once again not all that bad but for that hash rate it's a little steep now the hardware cost is around $200 for an a minor s5 right now that's with shipping and a power supply so if you want to get into mining even for a hobby or you want to buy Bitcoin miners for later use when you think the mining will be much more profitable this is really a good option because it's not all that expensive however looking at the overall profitability we can actually see that hourly you'd be losing four cents using this miner daily you'd be losing one dollar and five cents weekly $7.35 monthly you'd actually lose about $31 and annually you'd be losing 383 dollars and 20 cents now that's with power costing 10 cents per kilowatt hour so if we bump that down to 2 cents per kilowatt hour which is very cheap and if you have electricity of this cheap I definitely envy you and we calculate that you would actually be earning $9.25 a year with the a miner S 5 so if you have really cheap electricity it could still be profitable but it's going to take you about at nearly 8,000 days to break-even is it worth it it's really not so let's move on now to a slightly more powerful miner the amp miner s7 now the s7 is also not very expensive typically selling for about $300 with everything included the hash rate is higher here at about four thousand seven hundred and thirty Giga hashes per second and it uses just slightly more power or actually over over double power than the s5 but it's not all that much all things considered of roughly 1300 watts now with that being kept in mind the amp minor s7 still isn't all that profitable in fact you'd be losing seven cents an hour with this miner at ten cents per kilowatt-hour one dollar and seventy three cents per day twelve dollars and ten cents per week fifty-two dollars roughly per month and 631 dollars per year so unfortunately the hash rate really just can't save the overall power use now if your power is only costing you two cents per kilowatt-hour then that could be a different story if we look at this you would actually be earning two hundred and eighty dollars a year if you're only paying two cents per kilowatt-hour so if you can offset those costs for the power in any way the s7 could actually be a decent bet now that means that you break-even in 391 days with this miner which all things considered isn't great but if the value of Bitcoin which is currently sitting at right around 7 grand increases then you could be looking at a decent pay out so it can't be completely written off now let's move on once again to another slightly more popular and more profitable ant miner now this is the ant miner t9 + and I do have to warn all of you the ant miner t9 + is basically a down clocked version of the ant miner s9 and it's supposedly more stable than the s9 but it still uses a lot of power so let's go ahead and break down some stats on the a miner t9 + now it uses about 10,000 to 500 Giga hashes per second or produces about 10,500 Giga hashes per second uses about fourteen hundred and fifty watts of power pretty substantial honestly but the hash rate is obviously much better now four hundred and fifty dollars is a pretty good price for this whole unit with the power supply and included so if you can find it for that price it's pretty much a good deal now if we go ahead and examine the profitability of the ant miner t9 plus we can actually see that you'd be losing about two cents per hour about thirty-nine cents per day about two dollars and seventy four cents per week and monthly about eleven dollars and seventy five cents so that means that each year with ten cents per you'd be losing about one hundred and forty two dollars which isn't all that good once again and really isn't profitable however if we take the power cost down to two cents per kilowatt hour like we have for the other miners you would actually make 873 dollars a year meaning that you would break-even in 188 days which is honestly right now quite good so once again it appears to so if you could offset those power costs you would still be in pretty good shape so let's move on now to the hosted ASIC Bitcoin miner what's miner m3v to 1300 Tara hashes per second which comes with a power supply now I do want to go ahead and disclose that these miners are generally used for cloud contracts however this miner is free standing and you can buy it on eBay it's not being used for cloud contract at all and for that reason it's actually still pretty viable option so let's go ahead and look at some stats now mine's in about 1,300 or 13,000 pardon me Giga hashes per second she's actually pretty respectable however uses 2200 watts of power which is pretty steep now these miners like I said if they're used in mining farms they're typically being used over in China or nations where the power cost is pretty minimal or even next to nothing so for that reason these miners typically draw more power which is bad in the United States or wherever you might be that has more expensive power but not necessarily bad for mining farms as they tend to be a bit cheaper and they tend to be pretty reliable as well so this miner mines at 13,000 Giga hashes per second uses 2200 watts of power the hardware cost here is 250 USD which you know isn't too bad all things considered it's pretty inexpensive that's with shipping and everything and a power supply so if we go ahead and look at this it would lose you about 6 one dollar and forty six pence per day about ten dollars and nineteen cents per week every month you would lose about forty three dollars and sixty nine cents using this minor and annually you would lose about five hundred and thirty one dollars and fifty five cents which generally like I said is not that good however if we reduce the power cost here to two cents per kilowatt-hour and take a look at that you would actually be earning about a grand a year which is really pretty darn good and that means that you would break even in just 90 days so once again if you have cheap power or a way to make your power cheap such as wind power etc you absolutely can still make good money with these miners and that's a Bitcoin at around 7 grand obviously we've seen prices much higher than that in the past so let's go ahead and move on now and look at the piece de resistance or the amp minor s9 now the s9 is the most powerful and power effective miner on our list however it's not necessarily the least expensive and it's actually pretty costly so let's go ahead and look at some stats now mine's at 13,500 Giga hashes per second or 13.5 tera hashes per second it uses thirteen hundred and twenty watts of power which isn't all that bad the hardware cost is where it kind of gets you it will cost about seven hundred and fifty dollars for an amp minor s9 with the power supply in hand so the shipping isn't exactly that chief because it's pretty bulky and these are still desirable so people aren't exactly letting them go for next to nothing however if you compare this with the prices that we've seen in the past for the s9 of nearly five thousand dollars during the Bitcoin craze of December then you can definitely see that the price is way lower than it used to be so let's go ahead and look at some stats now this is the only miner on this list that is actually profitable right now without cheaper power for example you'd be earning three cents per hour eighty cents per day five dollars and sixty two cents per week twenty four dollars and eight cents per month and annually two hundred and ninety three dollars and one cent so really like I said all things considered the power cost isn't all that severe when you look at what you're actually making now if you learn that power cost to an even lower level of two cents per kilowatt-hour and take a gander at that let's go and see what we get you would actually be making one thousand to two hundred and eighteen dollars a year now that means you break even in two hundred and twenty four days so while the a minor s9 is the most powerful minor and the most power effective minor it isn't necessarily the best and if you have very cheap power you're honestly better off buying something else such as the minor that was used for hosting as the break-even period of 90 days is actually pretty good on that one so in my personal opinion is it bad to get into Bitcoin mining right now well not necessarily the miners are cheap and everything is actually still going pretty smoothly for Bitcoin mining so if you want to buy a minor now and then just hold on to it without even plugging it in until Bitcoin goes up in value which is something that I definitely think will happen that wouldn't necessarily be a bad idea you could even buy the miners now when mining isn't as popular and sell them on for a pretty substantial profit of course there's no saying necessarily that the miners will increase in value but we have typically seen definite boom bust periods for mining in the past so anyway folks that's my take on mining right now I hope as always that you found this video helpful if you did feel free to drop it a like share and subscribe I'll see all of you in the next one have fantastic to everyone and adios",

            "transcript": "  what everybody welcome to will you take so crypto currencies like Bitcoin any theorem has really gotten huge this last year or so it's so big that you won't even get your hands on any AMD graphics cards literally there are X 405 and series are sold out almost everywhere even in South Africa one of the suppliers sold over five hundred to a single minor which is crazy so the reason cryptocurrencies is so popular now is because of how easy it is to mine and how profitable it is one Bitcoin is $2,800 and etherium is 260 dollars so that's a lot of money just for something you mined in your spare time so in this video I'm going to tell you guys how to start Bitcoin mining I'm first thing on the focus on bitcoins because it's the easiest to get at the moment so I'm going to tell you guys how to do this at home with your PC your gaming PC you can just leave it there it does everything on its own you literally don't have to do anything just pay electricity bill that's that's all okay so before starting rich we could take a look at the Bitcoin price so at the moment it's going for two thousand eight hundred and eighty dollars it actually went up like just this ain't going to go with five dollars which is pretty crazy it just keeps going up so just to show you guys today it almost reach three thousand dollars so that's just today let's take the loss let's take the loss here let's just check how that spite it's going crazy now let's we check out aetherium as well so it started at like $14 $10 $11 and then it just shot up which is pretty crazy so easier theorem is also not bad to mine the only thing is we're going to mostly focus on the night hash minor which mines in bitcoins so that's but you can also do this if you really wanted to so next up let's quickly take a look at the water mine calm so this is also just to show you guys how many different type of coins there are there's literally thousands of them so these are just the ones that's currently the most profitable so for instance Taiwan but just you and I really have to worry about these I'm just going to show you guys so there's nice hash it's really going strong with naysha nice hash at the moment and then there's a theory most also growing but next up let's take a look at nice as the minor ok so to start mining you're going to need a nice hash minor so you can just go to nice hash comm and click on the cell hashing power so once there you can just click on the nice hash miner over here click on that you're going to download and then you're just going to install the program again then once you've opened the program you will see this this is the nicest miner you'll see up here you're the server location I just personally use the hunter damn one you can see your Bitcoin address over there and your worker name cheating change that if you want to and then also you see your jeep your CPU and a GPU which you can mine with sometimes you won't see a CPU it which it doesn't support but personally you're not going to CPU cannot but person you're not going to mind with your CPU because it's just going to be a waste you can mind with the GPU so just - all you have to use let's recreate a wallet which I'll show you guys now and then you're just going to start so then once it starts you'll actually see down here the global write you how much you're making per die so I'm making about three dollars per day your balance at the moment and then how much you is D that is so that's just for a week though so let's see it keeps out for a week and then pays you out so it went a bit up over three point three so let's see that's all you have to do you just stop mining like that so how it works it it uses different algorithms to mine with so it actually mines your theory M as well and then like Z cash as well and then it converts that into bitcoins and they pay you out in met coin because bitcoin is the most popular with some of the miners with some of the programs you can actually see your temperatures your usage and how much power you're using so that's just a nice indicator but anyways let's quickly check out our the rest of the settings so first off when you're going to start it's going to ask you to run a benchmark to see how much you're gonna make so these are the different algorithms you can use some GPUs don't have all of them so personally I've find that Q hash library and Lyra mines the best for me so you can just run that and then that's pretty much all you get your additional settings your address again worker named blah blah blah and then also the different algorithms you can select to run with so that's pretty much it for the miners pretty straightforward so now I'm quickly going to show you guys how to create your own Bitcoin wallets I prefer to create your own Bitcoin wallets you can use the link in description it's a philia thing that will take you to wire X so the affiliate link will help me and also help you if you use that you're gonna get 25% off on your Bitcoin cord so the Bitcoin core is actually literally a debit card you can use to draw money at a ATM or just swipe in-store so that's really really awesome I'm personally ordering one now and I'll make a video once it arrives so all you do is let's use register for free you're going to put in all your details and everything blah blah blah and that's pretty much it so once done you're going to come here and you can see all your bit going to how much you've made and then also this is going to be the where anything happens so when you've got money when you spend money it's just going to show here so at the moment today I was paid out by nice ash and I made point zero three bitcoins just around that off so that's just for the week so that's about an $85 around about there so that's not bad for just a week of work and for doing nothing so you can also see here I've got point 1 5 bitcoins I've made that's about four hundred and twenty dollars so that's not bad for actually doing nothing so you can also create your virtual core which you can go use some online stores like eBay and Amazon and then also you can order your Bitcoin core which is about when I ordered was about eleven dollars so if you use my affiliate link you'll get 20% 25% off which isn't bad and then ya like I said I'll just make a video once it arrives just to actually show guys if it works and if not but likely if you create the the wire scout and you find it's not useful you can just transfer all your money to a different wallet so that you won't be stuck just on yrx it's just going to cost a small transaction fee okay so that's pretty much it for the wallet now I'm just going to show you guys actually how much your cards will make so let's for instance say you have a gtx 960 3 gig which some like one I have now so down here you can add electricity cost as well I don't pay electricity so I don't really care I put it on the lowest you can go on 0 so you can add it there so they say it's just 10 cents per kilowatt hour and then let's quick calculate and then just going to show you actually how much you can make so this is your clean incomes like up for the 24 hours you're going to make three point six dollars and the power cost is going to be about 24 sinks which isn't a lot that's a profit of 3.3 I dollars per day so let's take that in a month that's about a hundred and seven dollars profit of the hundred and seven dollar income and a hundred dollars profit so for doing nothing you can get a hundred dollars so that's literally you can pay off the ten sixty that you get paid off in seventy five days if you run it strict so here you can see the algorithms that's going to make you the most money so but likely nice hash does everything for you so you that you don't have to do anything we can quickly take a look at the AMD card so let's we could take the RX 5 580 for instance so they do use a bit more power so you can see up here at the cost and the power the 1060 used about a hundred watts and it costs a bit more though so just keep that in mind but you can pay this one off in seventy seven days so the ten sixty is actually catching up to the card which is really nice and then also you can go up to let's say high precision have a 980 as you late that and then that makes also about three dollars around butter they usually make about three dollars but you have to calculate in the cost of the card and then also the power so this one's going to take 150 days so that you eat twice as long just to pay off so you can just come to the nice hash profit calculator it's literally down here on nice hazards website and then you can just add your Corder it does have a few different ones so one of our old course was a 650 TI I can let me show you guys you don't make anything on that so come here just to check before you start so I would say if you have a GTX 970 or higher you can actually do it lower than that you're not really going to make that much GTX tent by 960 it's going to make you about 1.5 which really isn't that much so I rather say you could have a new record or or stronger older course so I can show you guys the 1050 Ti as well that's about $2 so that's also you pay it off in 72 days so that's pretty nice and then once you've started mining everything you can see how much you actually make this is your statistics us your wallet address and everything that will show you how much you make so at the moment I make about $7 a day and I have made $2 today 2.4 dollars just for today so yeah you can see how much you've made that's where the payout mark is so I was paid out of it at 12 and then this is the race I made so you can also see the next payout it's going to be about 48 dollars if I keep but my current mining and then for the daily income you'll see that that's so that's just a rough calculation of how much you will make so like I said the nicest miner is just so easy to work with you're literally don't have to do anything it does literally everything for you so you just sit back you just mine again you just have to unfortunate very for electricity there but that's kind of all so again you just cry the wallets you down like nicest minor you just say start and there you make money so there is still a lot of stuff you have to consider like the exchange and where you actually have to exchange your money your your Bitcoin into real world money if you don't use yrx where you can actually get a card so that's a bit of an issue and then also your hardware so it does reduce the lifespan of your hardware and then you're gonna if you want to go into bigger stuff you're going to need a dedicated miner so that's also a lot of money you're going to spend but I am going to buy a few cards just to start mining want to get a six cord rig so I'm gonna go into a lot more detail later on this is just literally to show you guys how to start mining and get some money so again it's relatively simple to do this I hope this video is actually easy enough for you to follow I'll see how it actually goes my first like tutorial video almost so please let me know in the comments below guys okay so then also you can if you want to donate some bitcoins to me you can donate a point zero zero zero one Bitcoin if you really wanted to it's just going to help me out a bit I'll leave my wallet address down below so you just go on Warrick's and you just say send money and then you just use my my wallet so that's pretty much it also if you're all looking to buy some graphics cards to mine with you can go check out rebel tic you can get some very nice offers there as well so just make sure it has at least two fans because sometimes I do get a bit hot so just make sure they have enough cooling but yeah that's pretty much it and that is my video of how to start Bitcoin mining I hope you guys enjoyed if you did please like share subscribe and comment also if you if you start a Bitcoin mining please let me know how you find it if it's actually worth it to you because personally I found it very profitable for me it's very easy to do and you just make money so that's great but yeah tell me guys what you find of it and also you can go watch my video where I build my new rising system and where reviews of new corsair RGB memory and reviewed a GPX 1080 from a suits so you can watch all that also and then also if you have questions about bitcoins or anything else you just want to ask me you can ask me on Twitter or in the comments below again yeah you can follow me on Twitter Instagram and Facebook and then also you can subscribe to my second youtube channel we do stuff trying I'm going to try to post more videos there as well got to make that like

            "transcript": "  what's up guys welcome back to the channel my name is Bruce Wang in this video I'm gonna go over my Bitcoin mining equipment if you take a look over my right shoulder you can see that I have four ant miners and they're all turned off and there's a great is a good reason for that the electricity cost in my era is too high so it's not profitable for me to even run any of these miners and also have for 1080 tea eyes which I converted into a video editing computer so right now it's September 17th I'm just gonna go over some of the mining difficulty for crypto currency in general I'll and I'll let you guys know the numbers that I was I was getting and I am I would be getting today if I was still mining let's go over to nice ash nice hash is the website where I did all of my cryptocurrency mining it was the easiest website to use at the time and I think it probably still is so let's look at the 1080 T is the 1080 T eyes are right here and the Crypt and the currency that I was using as USD for myself I was getting I have to pay about 20 cents per kilowatt-hour and that is the main reason why I had to stop all of my high Bitcoin mining because this is just too expensive in my air is just too expensive for electricity and if I were to be mining today I would be getting every month negative 8 dollars so as you can see is a lot better to just buy cryptocurrency rather than mine for cryptocurrencies right now but let's say if you were getting about ten cents per kilowatt-hour you actually might be in the green so you'll be making ten dollars per card per month which is still pretty bad but if you were getting about six cents where it's actually some people get six cents per kilowatt-hour you'll be making almost seventeen dollars per month which is a lot better so let's look at the s9 SDS knives were one of the most popular ant miners during the time and let's look at the profitability for me I will be losing $100 per month if I was still running this so it's good that I'm not running it let's look at the L three pluses so LP plus is de mine litecoin and I'll be in the negative of negative $67 per month so as you can see that is the main reason why I decided to just stop all my mining and I'm considering selling all this because I have pretty much nothing else to do other than just look at it on the shelf let's see what I paid for it so I bought all my equipment on bit mean and if we look at the first tab here all of their equipment looks like it's on it looks like it's on sale back in January all this would probably be like $2,000 or more and during that time they didn't even have all these d6 and miners there's a lot of different ones now I these when they came out there they use a lot less electricity and I think that's why they're a lot better than the ones aren't that that I got originally so I haven't actually looked into all these but I know that my Asics they are 14.5 Tara hashes all these even come with the PSU so these are all really cheap but you would have to see you have to plug these in into the nice hash calculator while calculated on another website to see exactly how much you will be making if you were to buy this but I suggest you guys do your research and if you want to get into mining just don't get into mining unless you're getting free electricity so when I bought the so right now I'm looking at the light point miners and miner l3 plus is the one I have I bought I got mine for about 1500 in January and now they're on sale for about 200 USD which is like a fraction of the price let's take a look at Amazon Amazon is where I got all my 1080 T eyes and during the gold rush of cryptocurrency back in the days I think all all GPUs were about double the price as they are now so right now 700 is it it's a still a little bit overpriced but it's a lot better than it was before 700 you can get one of my 1080p eyes I bought mine for about 700 a little bit more than that this is the exact same one that I got but now I've pretty much - well I'm trying to turn my GPU miners into a editing computer I'm contemplating if I should even make a video about that but it might be interesting if you guys if you guys interested in it let me know leave a comment in the description some other 1080p eyes they're about the same price the zotac is 680 not too bad the 1080s are 560 so this is a pretty good deal but a lot of the GPUs are going back to normal price ranges because cryptocurrency mining it's it's on his way out pretty much if you're a small-time miner like I was it's not going to be worth it to even start but if you're looking to put like a lot of capital into it that's Prabha I mean that would probably be more beneficial especially if you can get really cheap electricity rates I've seen a lot of other videos where miners they open up their mining facilities right next to a hydropower plant and they would get really cheap electricity that would open it up in a you know a shipping container so that's something you might be interested in doing if you guys are really hardcore about it but for a small-time miner like myself I'm pretty much transitioning out of the game so there's been a lot of in the past day or two there's been a downward trend in the cryptocurrency market not sure why that is but Bitcoin has been hovering around 6,000 7,000 range so if you guys want a swing trade I think that might be a potential time for you guys to a good time for you guys to swing trade that I'm still planning to make and update on my finance account let you guys know what type of trades I've been doing but to sum it up now I've been buying Bitcoin when it's about this low six thousand six thousand one hundred six thousand two hundred and I've been selling it when it goes over six thousand five hundred went over seven thousand that's when I sold one of those seven thousand as well but I haven't been really active in Bitcoin trading I've been consolidating my portfolio trying to get out of those all coins that I took a gamble on but I'll save that for another video this week that's gonna be it for today's video thank you guys for watching hopefully this update into the mining game has been enlightening to you if you guys are still considering if you guys are still considering to mine Bitcoin at the moment I recommend you guys to really do your research and only do it if you're getting free electricity or really cheap electricity other than that thank you guys for watching if you've made it this far in the video I would appreciate it if you liked it and subscribe leave a comment let me know what type of content you're enjoying these days and let's get this discussion started I'm uploading a lot more consistent lately and I will hope to see you guys in another video soon thank you guys for watching again I'll catch you guys later bye",

            "transcript": " Sean&gt; How do Bitcoin miners mine? Mike&gt; There's no actual digging involved. Think back to our video on hashing - so a hash function takes a message of any length and returns a fixed length hash which hopefully looks quite random right so if you change even a little bit of your message the whole hash changes, so this is how Bitcoin mining works right in brief... So we have a block and at the top of the block is the hash of the previous block and a number right which we're going to call our nonce this is a number we're making up let's start at 1 and go up and then here we've got all the transactions so transactions - one of which will give me some bitcoins because I'm the miner. The way this works is I start with a random number here and then I hash this entire thing and I get a hash out the bottom here. To mine successfully this hash needs to be very very small so let's say for example it has ten leading zeros as an example if I successfully pick a number where when I hash this entire thing including the number it has ten leading zeros I've successfully mined that Bitcoin. Now that's quite unlikely you've got to think that each zero &amp; one has a roughly 50% chance of being a one so to get one leading zero it's going to be about 50% of the time two leading zeros about 25% of the time and so on the more leading zeros we require the harder this process is. So it doesn't happen yeah the first time I pick a one I hash it and it doesn't work so what I do is I go to 2 and I hash it again and I get a totally different hash which maybe has a different number of leading zeroes and I go \"does this does this work?\" no, ok so 3, 4 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 and so on and I just keep churning away with these random numbers in this \"nonce\" field here incorporating any transactions I've received in the meantime until I get this kind of golden hash that I've been looking for which is very very small so lets say 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 some numbers say 1 0 1 1 and something like that right now this is sha-256 in the case of Bitcoin so it's 256 bits long now as soon as I've done that I go well brilliant I've got some bitcoins i transmit this to the network and everyone sees this and goes cool and then they take this hash and they put it in the next block and start mining on that one as well with new so every time someone stumbles across a hash which is small enough that's when they've mined the Bitcoin right and so that's how the difficulty of a network is changed - you just change the threshold of number of zeros or size of your hash that you need to be below in order to be successful every couple of thousand blocks the network will look at how long it took and if like a bunch more miners have appeared so it's actually starting to get a little bit too easy they'll they'll increase this such that hopefully a Bitcoin is mined roughly every ten minutes now of course this process is random so it might be less, might be more but on average... If a bunch of miners disappeared suddenly it's taking 50 minutes to mine a Bitcoin (Block?) they'll just reduce this threshold so that you can mine that little bit more easily. The number of bitcoins that a miner is awarded is halved every so often as well - so I think is it at 12.5 at the moment so I will have sort of plus 12.5 for Mike in here as sort of my benefit of being the miner so this will only ever get actually put into the blockchain if I'm the one that finds this hash otherwise unfortunately it'll be someone else's name in here Sean&gt; we've sat here and watched Beast churn through billions of password hashes - How hard can it be to come up with this number? Mike&gt; As hard as they need it to be you've got to think that for all the miners on earth at least a lot of them have got dedicated hardware many trillions of hashes and they're still only doing it every 10 minutes right it's not easy to do and they can just keep making this more difficult until it takes about ten minutes. In some ways you can't make the problem more easy by buying more and more hardware because it will just make itself more difficult for you. For now most of my contact with it is via a terminal and I ask it to do things it does them very, very fast. This particular server has four Titan X graphics cards in it a Titan X is one of the foremost graphics cards there are new....",

            "transcript": "  hi guys I walk up to how much Bitcoin YouTube channel today I'm super excited because I'm gonna build the strongest script reminder I've ever built on how much Bitcoin YouTube channel if you're new to this channel go ahead and subscribe and click on notification button you get all the videos that make all the time in this video we're gonna do a giveaway I'm gonna give away this 1050 Ti because I have all those as you guys gave me so much love and so many subscribers thank you guys so much so in order to win this all you have to do is share this video on social networks and comment below on the video where you shared it doesn't matter where you are in the world I'll ship it to you so let's review what can equipment I'm gonna need to use to build one of those waves this is 6 GT X 1080 T is each one of them has 11 gigabyte of G RAM that's is crazy because they consume so much power about 300 watts each they might get to up to 1900 watts total power consumption for this way so I'm going to 1000 watt EVGA power supplies to be able to give tho the power to the video cards we can also need some RAM 8 gigs of DDR 4 I have some basic Celeron but it's the new version the LGA one 151 CPU and we have a 120 gig SSD just a simple drive to be able to run everything pretty quickly we have 6 razors the razors who connect each video card to the PCI Express ports I also have a motherboard right here it's gonna support 6 GPUs with the raises it's gonna connect to the motherboard so you can run all those at the same time also I hear that's the case that's the mining rig case where we put all the video cards in and the motherboard the power supply so this there are whole enclosure of the things now to start with hunt box all this equipment pull it all up and then start assembling let's start with the mining rig this is the front panel with the little screen you have a power and reset button and the front screen have like controller for the fans and you know CPU temperatures and all that this is the side frames there's a screw kit here with some zip ties this time I'm gonna do my best organize the cable nicely and six fans those are actually very very useful with the airflow it keeps the GPU is nice and cool now let's start assembling it to assemble this rig as you can see this numbers here one two three and four so it kind of tells you what to put everything curls here as you can see here there's also numbers so you mention it for example it says one and two here and it says one and two right here wanted to wanted to you just put them like this and you screw it in it's that easy so I'm gonna go ahead and do that right now there's little bags in there with all the screws as you can see sets HDD and each one it says what it what it's for and here's the screws for the case and this is the little tool that came with same thing on the other side four two four three two three before we install the second part of the frame we're gonna install the motherboard support holder now that we installed the motherboard plate we're gonna go ahead and install the second part of the case [Music] and we're gonna do the same thing for the other side we now gonna install this SSD right here it's easier to do it now here's the pack of screws for the HDD screws or SSD this is the bottom of the rig and I'm just gonna screw in the SSD in there now we're gonna unbox and install the 1000 watt power supply one out of two we're gonna need all those cables later when we plug in all the video cards so put those aside for now so as you can see I put the two power supplies here for now and I'm just you know organizing the cables realizing where the cables will be this is the motherboard connection both of them need it one of them will have the little jumper so it's always on and the second one will be connected to the motherboard itself so we turn on when we plug it in comes with the EVGA power supply and that's really nice of them to do that and all you do is click it in and then as soon as you plug in this to the power it will turn on and the second one will go to the motherboard so let's go ahead and put all the cables that we need right now all the PCIe Express with cables and all the power cables right now because once we screw in it will be hard to add on here is the first power supply I'm gonna start organizing the cables nicely and put some zip ties because there's not a lot of space here so I'm gonna use the included zip ties it came with a case to organize the cables here so this is the main power supply this will power up the fan the CPU the motherboard and the SSD so I already plug in the SSD right here from here so now I'm gonna go ahead and install the second power supply that's power up the other three video cards and then I'm gonna screw everything in once I know everything is set okay I'm pretty much done with the cabling if I miss any cable I'm gonna add it on for now I'm gonna leave it without screwing it in and put the motherboard it now first let's click in the i/o plate for the motherboard now let's install motherboard carefully here is the motherboard plates we're gonna go ahead and screw all the screws in the motherboard plate screws are already installed I didn't have to install them this time now let's go ahead and install the CPU and the ramp on the last video many of you asked me about the thermal paste it's already from Intel so I did not have to add it now we're going to install the CPU fan to RAM sticks motherboard power connection CPU power plug it in now let's connect the SSD to the motherboard with a SATA cable that was included in the motherboard let's plug in the power to the front LED panel the front LCD panel need to be connected to the motherboard using those small cables those connections will let the LCD panel we start the computer started power button and then some LEDs for the hard drive and LEDs for the power of the motherboard this is how it looks like after installed the front panel little connections to the motherboard and then we can power it up the next step is to actually not install the video card yet I want to make sure that this computer works as it is to kind of like avoid issues after so I'm gonna start with those off with a USB you can install those from Amazon you can buy those ok so before we start putting all the video cards in I think the best way is to make sure the computer works and you start windows on it to kind of avoid issues later so let's go ahead and start it for the first time whoa it starts perfect first Roy let's install Windows now so now I'm gonna change the above for GD coding this helps me install more than one video card I already had some issues not having this enabled and this is disabled by manufacturer I'm gonna enable that everything else is great and I'm gonna go ahead and install Windows now so this little device was sent to me by open - dev that are you this is actually air on another PC I raised there so I can add another eraser here you know and I can have seven GPUs if I want to now this is a really cool device I will leave a link below thank you guys so much for sending me this this is yes now that our computer is installed with Windows I'm gonna go ahead and download the latest Nvidia graphics card drivers and to do so I'm gonna go to google and type Nvidia drivers now I already know the system so we can actually download it ourselves and choose the right one so we have the 10 series and we're gonna select 1080 TI and download the latest one I'm downloading it ahead of time because when once I installed it will be easier the drivers to load up and there's gonna be less problems with black screen or you know not finding the drivers or anything like that so I'm installing it ahead of time now the next step is to unbox all the video cards and install them one by one and connect them all to the power supplies here's the first one really good card with a backplate I already tested one of those before but we're gonna install six of them today so as you can see here we have six screws that holds the GPUs we're gonna go ahead and under stall one of them then we're gonna grab one of the PCIe razors and this cable right here gonna connect to the motherboard here's the razor connection it's gonna go in right here as you can see we have more of those we're gonna go one by one so this is the first one now let's go ahead and hook up the video card okay let's go ahead and hook up the razor and then lock it back in and now that we know what size it is how long it is I know that I could put the support right here for the video card it comes with two of those but I only need one now also don't forget to provide power to the razor the only power as well all six of them plug in the USB for the razor right here now connect the razor power to the power supply all right we have one video card ready now let's do five more Wow okay we install the six video cards and the six razors but now we have to power up all the power plug the PCIe power plugs vga whatever you call it so one power supply in charge of three and then another power supply in charge of three of them so I split it in case one fails three will continue to run and then if the main one fails then both of them is not gonna work but at least we have two as a backup let's start with the first three there are eight pin vga power for each one two of them I finish all the cable management holy cow this it's so hard to do six video card cable management there's so many cables for each one but all working I went in and I installed one video card at a time and I make sure that all of them showing up on nice hash all of them are running right now but now we only have to do is to put the fans on okay the fans are on it's all done now we're gonna plug it in run some nice hash I'll do a thorium too if you want to do a different pool whatever pool you want and then this will take probably hours to benchmark so we're gonna have to wait but everything is said the six racers six gtx 980ti is just beautiful look at it it's imagined it clean this is possible number one every two everything is all set just beautiful so let's go ahead and do a benchmark and see what happens all right the computer is working perfectly I downloaded nice hash and run the benchmark the benchmark takes like two hours no kidding with that many video cards it tests each one nice ash is an OK solution for mining because they do payout and they fix the issues they used to have some issues and hacking issues and stuff but now they're working fine just make sure that if you are mining you have a big mining rig because the payout is very high I think it's a point one Bitcoin so you have to make a thousand dollars just to get paid so just remember that so if you don't want a miner nice hash we can also mine on earth miner org all you have to do is follow the instructions here I'll show you you go to a Windows bundle because I'm running Windows and then just download this one the latest one and I'm gonna put it on a desktop once it's done all you have to do is extract it to the desktop and after that open it and then create a new notepad file in the notepad you're gonna copy the instructions from Earth miner org and just change your information to your wallet so then you get get paid so your if money address will go here and the rig name will go here I'm gonna put you there I'm gonna save it if miner that vit to actually execute the ad minor and then you have a little execution file here you click it the windows batch file it opens up and then mine's just fine I'm gonna wait for nice hash to finish so let's take a look at nice hashish performance alright $42.00 per day Wow so it seems like five of the video cards running equal ha at 3.4 kilo hashes and then one of them is mining the delivery and then it's at 400 mega hashes total $42 per day wow that's a lot of money so if we calculate that per month forty two point four times thirty dollars per month that's one thousand two hundred and seventy two dollars per month now don't forget this is not a cheap set up this is one of the best video cards in the world okay and this is six of them so that's why the performance is so high make sure you know that this number represents right now but in the future that number might change higher or lower it depends on how many people buy mining contracts from nice action how much those scripts make in general how much those light coins how much those out coins actually worth change a lot on how much profit you're gonna make but that's just amazing this is not overclocked no nothing I'm not gonna overclock it yet what we're gonna do now is check how much wattage are we drawing right now and I'm actually using two plugs let's also check some temperatures so I'm gonna down specky I like this software it's very easy to use it's free it's fast so I recommend it to check out the statistics of the temperatures now something to notice my lighting is kind of like when when it start mining my house lighting can I get them you know how in the movies where there's a lot of power draw the whole city's like you know power goes down kind of thing now my house like lights and stuff are like you know affecting by the power it takes it takes a lot of power I mean I think it takes more than aunt mana s9 so it's a really powerful machine so make sure your house can stand it because I think my house is kind of like the maximum you know I'm pulling out the maximum I can you know more than that it's gonna jump my whole house so it's kind of cool you know that you reach those limits I like it once specky is downloaded they will just open up and scan your whole system and here you go look at that yeah that's that's high temperatures I was expecting it 79 to 82 in a much expecting to get to which like 85-89 when it's a little warm in here because it's a bit cold right now not super cold but it's a bit chill so temperatures will be high and that's those those are running pretty high 1080 T is running pretty high and don't forget they're really really close to each other those fans you saw in the front in the back there do help move the air around but still they're so close to each other so now let's check out how much power this machine takes you can see it's making 46 dollars a day this is how much power it takes 1780 watts holy cow I think it's beeping because that's pretty much the maximum that you can take out for one socket it works perfectly though the two one thousand power supply split the power between them so the only taking like nine hundred each or nine hundred something each it's not too bad it's not reaching their limit yeah just look at those lights it looks like those video cards was designed to mine those flashing lights almost look like the nth minor USB the you've won I know if you guys remember but that's how it was was just flashing lights like that and I think that's why it looks like that they make it look like old-school Bitcoin mining USB devices so that's awesome the air coming out in this way air coming in from that way so it actually works really well to cool down the cards and some of their cause up some of the yeah there goes this way alright guys it's all done six GTX 1080p eyes Wow they work perfectly they're mine forty six dollars a day that's crazy but it mines 1700 watts or over that a little bit every single day so that's about a hundred and twenty dollars a month or more I pay ten cents per kilowatt so it's not too bad but it depends on your country or whatever you are from you can't connect anything else to that socket that you're using that 10 amp socket the 20 amp hopefully 20 amps you can connect anything up there just that device and that's it because you know as soon as you turn on your light it will jump on my last solar experiment

            "description": "What is Bitcoin?\n\nBitcoin is a new currency that was created in 2009 by an unknown person using the alias Satoshi Nakamoto. Transactions are made with no middle men \u2013 meaning, no banks! Bitcoin can be used to book hotels on Expedia, shop for furniture on Overstock and buy Xbox games. But much of the hype is about getting rich by trading it. The price of bitcoin skyrocketed into the thousands in 2017.\n\nHow Bitcoin Mining Works ?\nWhere do bitcoins come from? With paper money, a government decides when to print and distribute money. Bitcoin doesn't have a central government.\n\nWith Bitcoin, miners use special software to solve math problems and are issued a certain number of bitcoins in exchange. This provides a smart way to issue the currency and also creates an incentive for more people to mine.\n\nThanks for watching \u2026..

            "transcript": "  hello everyone and welcome back to Bitcoin tips in today's video we are going to be talking about five of the best and highest paying cloud mining sites for August of 2018 so let's begin so first here we have Leo bot now I've been using yo bot for my entire time in cryptocurrency it's been a great site I would recommend it to anybody I did just release a video a few weeks ago about how to get gig hashes if you are a United States resident since they do they make it a little harder for you to get giga hashes but it is still possible so ile bot i've gotten paid every payment i've ever requested from them has been paid it's it's just a great site it's always worked they've got really fast responses for support stuff like that which is really good to see and they do have pictures of their actual miners so you can see what you're buying s9 miner farms and they are kind of not the best pictures but it does give you an idea of hey there is something out there in a warehouse that I'm purchasing so that's really cool but as you can see you can mine over 20 different types of coins and you can see here that it's all through just one Giga hash or one contract I'll call it that the Giga hash 4.0 is what you buy and that allows you ups that allows you to buy or mine any of these coins you can come into here going to diversify where every 10 minutes it switches between a coin or you can mine one coin at a time depending on which one your favorite is or if you just want to mine Bitcoin or - or Doge anything like that it's very cool system so if I scroll down here you can see with my 381 Giga hashes I am only making 3 cents a day 3 and a half cents isn't a lot but it is something like I said they do make it a little bit harder for people in the u.s. to obtain Giga hashes but there is still it is still possible so another great feature is they have a faucet that you can claim from once day so just fill out the CAPTCHA get your faucet rewarding since I'm mining Giga hashes I get paid in Giga hashes so that goes for any coin so if you were mining by coin you would have gotten your bonus in by coin which is really cool so yeah that's a Oh bot pretty much in a nutshell it works great I would recommend it to anybody and neo bot will be the first link in the description below so moving on to hash Flair now hash Flair's had some ups and downs recently with Bitcoin price being so low they did have to stop mining contracts for a little bit and it seems like it just depends on the day of the difficulty compared to the price of whether or not you'll get a payout but I did still want to mention it say hey sha-256 they do offer sha-256 script eutherian z cash and equi so that is but yeah so like I said they have had some ups and downs so I'm not gonna go into too much detail on hash flare just because of their up and down with paying but if you guys are interested in signing up for an account it'll be the second link in the description below moving on to Genesis mining Genesis mining has been around for a long time they've got a couple really cool things on their main web page they have a video showcasing different shots of their warehouses that they have now in my opinion yeah that's great they're showing you that they have computers and stuff like that but something else that Genesis really does that's really cool in my opinion is they invite third party people on YouTube to come to their warehouses and make video anybody can make a fake video about their own company whereas if you have a third party person come out there then I think it's a legit company so Genesis mining is very legit I get paid from them every single day for my mining speed here you can see they offer six different contracts that you can purchase my main one is Bitcoin and then the rest of these are just little bits that I have gathered up and they pay out every once in a while so some exciting news for Genesis's they are now able to sell sha-256 to people recently they haven't been able to due to lack of computer power and different laws and stuff but they are now able to buy Giga hashes sadly the minimum investment is $285 which is a lot but if you guys are interested I have a three percent off discount code in the description so Genesis will be the third link in the description with a three percent off code so yes Genesis is another really good recommended site I really like it because it does pay every day it is a little bit expensive to get into but I think if you are looking for a trusted cloud mining site and don't really have a minimum investment then Genesis would be a great start for you so moving on to Westland storage now Westland storage is a little bit of a cloud mining site a little bit of an investment site it says 1% profit a day I don't know how true that is I don't think I really get 1% today but I do get paid from them and I've gotten every payment I've requested from them obviously you do have to meet the minimums and stuff like that but they are a great site so I always like to mention them like I said it's not really a cloud mining site but it is an investment site that does pay you daily so I like to talk about it and vention it it will be the fourth link in the description below but you can invest using Bitcoin litecoin Bitcoin cash - yes Irian Zee cash dogecoin or Visa which is really cool so you can use a credit card as well so I think that is really cool and I I recommend Wesleyan storage to anybody because I know a lot of people have been making a lot of money off of it I have only been using it for about 65 to 70 days so so far I counted as trusted but I don't know if that the that they will continue paying so remember this is your money in your decision with all of these websites if you decide to invest and the site closes down for some reason then we all lost out so I think the first three here that I talked about they don't really have a risk of going anywhere this one may go away but as of right now it's paying and I really enjoy it so I would recommend it if you're looking to invest so moving on to our last cloud mining site crypto mining farm now I actually chose this site as my number one favorite cloud mining site for July halfway through 2018 and it is still my it's a great site I've been paid a lot from it I really really recommend this to anybody who's looking to invest they have a different system where if you go to buy Giga hashes you actually choose how long your contract is three months six months one year three or five year or lifetime now obviously lifetime and the higher years the longer your contract is the less you're gonna be able to get for your money so say you can get 1,000 Giga hashes for $10 now this is not the legitimate prices but for three months you can get 1,000 gig hashes for $10 well you may only be able to get 50 Giga hashes for lifetime for that same $10 but you're always gonna have those Giga hashes whereas for three months they you need to make your money back so it's profitable for you and profitable for the company so keep that in mind when you are buying but I think it is really cool that you can choose how long your contract lasts for and how much you want to buy so you can buy anywhere from a thousand all the way up to a hundred thousand Giga hashes at a time they do have the Giga hashes for VIP I guess and this is if you have over a hundred thousand Giga hashes your withdraw minimums or your withdrawal fee is a little bit less you have to have over a hundred thousand Giga hashes I don't know if I mentioned that yet but yes so definitely really cool I think the fee a little bit less is all that it is on here I don't think there's else that you don't get oh you don't get to change your email and you don't get to reinvest with V Giga hashes so I think that's a pretty cool option as well and I think that's about it for crypto mining farm like I said I recommend it to anybody who's looking to join it's really cool as you can see I have fifty six thousand one hundred and sixty seven point four six Giga hashes so I do have quite a bit of Giga hashes on it and I am still recommending it I've been using it since September of 2017 and I've gotten paid out every time normally in less than ten minutes there was one time where it took a day or so to get here but in my opinion as long as I get my money I don't really care how long it takes as long as it's not weeks and weeks but so again if you decide to invest in any of these cloud mining sites remember it is your money in your decision if you want to invest it is your your risk that you're taking so thank you guys for watching all the links to these sites will be in the description below along with a 3% off code for Genesis if you have any questions about these sites leave a comment and I'll try and answer all questions and comments and please like share and subscribe to my pick coin tips youtube channel to learn more about spending collecting earning and investing different types of cryptocurrencies thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed and I hope to see you in my next video bye",
