The theories of acupuncture and moxibustion hold that the human body acts as a small universe connected by channels, and that by physically stimulating these channels the practitioner can promote the human body's self-regulating functions and bring health to the patient. This stimulation involves the burning of moxa (mugwort) or the insertion of needles into points on these channels, with the aim to restore the body's balance and prevent and treat disease. In acupuncture, needles are selected according to the individual condition and used to puncture and stimulate the chosen points. Moxibustion is usually divided into direct and indirect moxibustion, in which either moxa cones are placed directly on points or moxa sticks are held and kept at some distance from the body surface to warm the chosen area. Moxa cones and sticks are made of dried mugwort leaves. Acupuncture and moxibustion are taught through verbal instruction and demonstration, transmitted through master-disciple relations or through members of a clan. Currently, acupuncture and moxibustion are also transmitted through formal academic education.\r\nCountry(ies): China\r\n\u00a9 2009 Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion\r\nDuration: 00:08:47 - Support: DVD (0042500018)",

            "transcript": "  the techniques of acupuncture and moxibustion in traditional Chinese medicine are a traditional knowledge and practice formed in the soil of ancient Chinese culture for regulating the body's balance and maintaining health they are based on the holistic concept of unity between man and nature under the guidance of the theories of the channels and acupuncture points it's practice involves the insertion of needles into specific points on the body or the burning of moxa to warm the surface parts of the body in order to relieve pain treat illness or promote health the holistic concept of unity between man and nature which stems from ancient Chinese philosophy views the living individual as a component part of the universe and explains life activities with a theory of yin and yang for instance in the natural world yin represents the earth the moon and night whereas Jung represents the sky or heaven the Sun and day inside the human body upward movement represents yang whereas stability and downward movement represents in yin and yang govern nature as well as the body's interior therefore if the yin-yang balance between the external environment and the body or that within the body is upset disease results the theories of acupuncture and moxibustion hold that the human body is a microcosm each part of which is connected by channels through long-term practice points on the channels have been discovered gradually developing into a systematic theory of which the twelve channels correspond to the 12 months and 365 acupuncture points to the 365 days of the year this theory embodies the dynamic relationship between heaven man and earth for instance if a patient has a toothache on the left side it can be treated by inserting a needle in the Huggle point on the right hand the principle of selecting points on the lower body for diseases in the upper or of selecting points on the right for diseases on the left reflects clearly acupuncture and moxibustion a holistic view of the human body as an integral whole the practice of acupuncture and moxibustion can be explained as follows in acupuncture the primary tool is the needle historically needles were made of special stones or metals such as bronze iron gold and silver today needles are mostly made of stainless steel needles are selected according to the individual conditions and used to puncture and stimulate specific points to dredge the channels methods such as lifting thrusting twirling and rotating or comprehensive needle techniques are used for both prevention and treatment of disease nine needles of different shapes and dozens of different needle techniques were recorded in the classic of acupuncture in the second to third century BC the primary material used for moxibustion is Artemisia commonly known as the moxa plant which has a particular fragrance and grows in most parts of China since ancient times the Chinese have believed that it has the ability to dispel pathogenic factors toxic combs and sticks are made of moxa wool processed from moxa leaves which have been dried up and ground into wool moxa combs and moxa wool burn with an even warmth for a long period of time moxibustion is usually divided into direct and indirect forms in which either moxa combs are placed directly on points or moxa sticks are held and kept at some distance from the body service to warm the points so as to adjust the yin and yang of the body and restore balance and health acupuncture and moxibustion have been constantly reinvented in response to the environment and interactions with nature and history therefore characteristic regional group or individual schools have formed through endless exploration over the course of several millennia acupuncturists throughout history have improved upon the ancient art of acupuncture and moxibustion the three-step needle techniques improved upon by chen shannon are based on the relationships between heaven earth and man they summarize the three needle depths of superficial middle and deep the three free flow needle techniques summarized by her Parran are based on severity of illness and applies slight warming and strong promotion of free flow to treat disease these needle techniques have had far-reaching influences on promoting the continuing existence of this tradition in China to be a recognized master of the acupuncture tradition requires apprenticeship under a renowned acupuncturist acupuncture and moxibustion are primarily transmitted through example as well as verbal instruction through inherited lineages formed by master pupil relations all members of a clan these tradition bearers are identified by their reverence for the mythological figures of Quan D and to become an excellent reputable acupuncturist requires long-term accumulation of knowledge and practical experience the bronze figure of acupuncture points cast in 1026 in the Song Dynasty the systematic classic of acupuncture and moxibustion compiled in 259 and the great compendium of acupuncture and moxibustion written in 1601 as well as other works are all a testimony to the inheritance and development of this tradition and have served as important reference materials in the study of acupuncture and moxibustion and have been playing a significant role in their continued development up to the present day among the Chinese people there are sayings such as one needle and a bundle of herbs keeps you healthy into old age and hanging matzo leaves on your front door keeps the doctor away all year round these sayings are evidence that acupuncture and moxibustion have had a huge impact on people's lives and also reflect the widespread recognition of this ancient tradition acupuncture and moxibustion are a type of natural therapy which requires no medicine this comprehensive body of knowledge and steady rate of development have played an important role in promoting health care for the sake of protecting its continuous existence the China Association of acupuncture and moxibustion the institute of acupuncture and moxibustion of the china academy of chinese medical sciences and associated communities have launched wide-ranging movements for the study and practice of this tradition Chinese acupuncture and moxibustion is a living body of ancient Chinese wisdom and cultural legacy",

            "transcript": "  traditional Chinese veterinary medicine although relatively new to the Western world is a medical system that has been used in China to treat animals for thousands of years the history of Chinese medicine actually began with people having the most natural reaction the world of places that were sore they would find a place that was sore and they would rub it and they would find that it would feel better and over time they began to determine that there were correlations between internal diseases and external pains and so they began to define a number of points that when they treated those points for that kind of pain it got better Chinese medicine is predicated on the ideas of transformation how how we can take for instance food and translate it into the substances of our body in disease that process is disrupted in Chinese medicine is predicated on observing the outside of the body how your body's functioning to determine a pattern of imbalance or bending and when we know that pattern we can treat it originally they were used like a combination of the acupuncture and herbal medicine for many illness acupuncture is good for musculoskeletal disease however for internal medicine case as a heart failure renal failure for instance we have to use medicine engine tender called Chinese herbal medicines to be better as a quicker canonical results and for skin conditions for instance we have to use like food therapy and the combined with herbal and acupuncture Treena is traditional Chinese medical manipulation that's many apply for the masks or skeletal illness the earliest tenants of Chinese medicine really come from the yellow Emperor's treatise on internal conditions we noticed these points were well written and well described we begin to notice that some of the points in people and animals could be transposed we use the same tenants from these written medical texts on people to try and apply them to animals and treat them as well as other things that we observed in Sawle that worked and so there was a an evolution starting with traditional Chinese medicine into traditional Chinese veterinary medicine Chinese medicine is based on the Taoist worldview that the body is a microcosm of the larger surrounding universe as such the cosmic laws and forces that govern the external world also govern the body's internal environment in short if I could summarize Taoism I would say that it says do what needs to be done and yield and go with the flow of nature but in Chinese medicine the idea of yin and yang is that process of transformation that relates to how the body functions and we can subdivide that into the relationships of organs within the body to each other that relates to the endocrine system and water metabolism the fluids of the body such as hormones and enzymes though Chinese medicine can be traced back over two millennia and recorded history it like any medical system continues to evolve today well as our testing in that in conventional medicine improves and we can do now functional MRIs where we can look at the brain in action as it's working so we know where certain acupuncture points activate certain parts of the brain and that's how we get different effects with different points the Chi Institute of Chinese medicine is a leading continuing education provider of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine with a main campus in Reddick Florida and program basis in Spain Australia and China the Chi Institute has proudly graduated nearly 4,000 licensed veterinarians from 50 countries and regions around the world since 1998 we teach whole traditional Chinese to attend medicine with each acupuncture we also teach the Treena medical manipulation and therapy so when the student come here the current all the traditional maternal medicine conventional Western medicine that good waste agnostic they have MRI x-ray bloodwork all those lab available Chinese medicine have a lot of rich information how to treat the patient how to get results so I find that Western medicine is a weakness is the Chinese their strength Chinese medicine the weakness of Western strength so ideally is the marriage together get him best result the Qi Institute believes that by utilizing both frameworks one will result in a more complete picture of the whole organism this morning I teach the class is renal failure case their thought is a very common illness in ancient and then call this CGI disorders or spleen disorder but if running blood work we find out blood work for the renal failure so in our woods Swiss on a years ago when they serve enough in your case they might have mystical assists but actually this issues caused by renal failure so right now we treat opposed the promote upper tide help animal digests better and also treat secondary function the clinical outcome would be much much better than sweet some years ago because the integrate of both the traditional Chinese veterinary medicine has its origins in China it has established a global presence in the past few decades that continues to grow today as a result the benefits of traditional Chinese veterinary medicine to animals and their human caregivers are broader reaching than ever before in the medical community of course there's always resistance to any change and now they're beginning to see there's such an overwhelming body of evidence as to that it works and how it works that that's beginning to be more accepted there also because I'm a veterinarian and I'm an acupuncturist sometimes I can take my veterinarian knowledge my conventional medical knowledge and use that to help me choose acupuncture points to treat the horse if I'm unclear of the acupuncture pattern I can use my conventional knowledge to help me with and then sometimes we have animals that we can't diagnose like a lame horse but we can't pinpoint why he's limping well I can use my acupuncture knowledge to diagnose that and treat it and get the patient fixed acupuncture is only one branch of the vast and complex field of traditional Chinese medicine in China acupuncture is rarely used alone and is instead combined with other traditional Chinese medical modalities there are four points of traditional Chinese virtual medicine there are acupuncture Chinese herbal medicine trainer and the photo therapy they integrate everything you can sell more issues not only about muscular skeletal issues disc issues but also internal medical disorders secondly integrate together you can't get in canonical results much much quicker and much more efficient the Chi Institute's permanent on-site campus and combined online opportunities allow students an unparalleled educational experience that is more convenient less costly and more time efficient than other acupuncture or traditional Chinese veterinary medical schools we always emphasize practical how is the simple either way integrate the Chinese medicine into conventional West medicine this very important the program itself is wonderful it's very convenient there's an online section and then there's an on-campus section so a lot of it you can do from home and you can go through the videos at your own pace we're also learning a little bit about herbs we're learning a little bit about food therapy so that entices all of us to get even more education beyond the program that we're starting with which is the acupuncture I plan on taking the information and education that I've received from the Qi Institute implementing it into my practice and turning my practice into an integrative veterinary hospital so that I can better serve my clientele ultimately the Qi Institute hopes for graduates to approach problems from both in Eastern and Western perspective practicing with a comprehensive understanding of health and disease and a wide array of treatment options for patients there is medicine and there's a tool chest mm I practice medicine and these are all the things that are in my tool chest and we see that the medicine of should agree with conventional medicine and we want to see that further improve by bridging that gap hoping to be a better benefit to our patients and our clients and the people that we serve and the patients we care for the education of the chance it has already affected my practice in a positive way as I've started to incorporate the things I'm learning I've already brought more options to patients that I didn't have before the Chi Institute's primary mission is to promote the

            "description": "Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is a collection of a broad range of healing practices sharing common concepts that developed over thousands of years in what we know today as China. These practices evolved long before the development of science-based medicine. Although most people see TCM as complementary to orthodox medicine for those suffering relatively trivial problems, some market it toward those suffering from serious health conditions with the promise of helping with their symptoms or, in some cases, flat-out curing them. Although false hope peddling is commonplace here online, I wanted to see if the same opportunistic (almost predatory) approach to selling unproven medical products and services to the very ill is being practiced in the real world.\n\nSupport Myles through Patreon\nhttp://patreon.com/powerm1985\n\nMISTAKE!!!\nI keep calling 3'-deoxyadenosine (Cordycepin) 3'-deoxyguanosine.

            "transcript": "  someone recently tried to sell me a traditional Chinese medicine remedy for fighting off cancer and the weird thing is it may actually do that [Music] hi Internet it's me Myles now traditional Chinese medicine is a broad range of healing practices all based around the same ideas that were developed in what we now know as China these practices developed well before science based medicine and includes things like gra\u00e7a cupping an acupuncture to name a few many attempts have been made to prove that traditional Chinese medicine for the most part works and noon of all of them have failed now this is because traditional Chinese medicine is based on superstitions on the metaphysical rather than evidence-based research despite this the use of traditional Chinese medicine has really increased here in the West in fact shops selling this stuff have become common on high street although most people see it as complementary alternative medicine and something that you should go to if you've got a no-strike stomach upset or something that's really not too serious some people try and push it to others who are really unwell and they promise things like it will help with their symptoms or even some of them will say this will flatten quu although false hope peddling is nothing new here online I wanted to see if the same thing was happening in the real world to see if people were selling products to very ill people so I turned up one day at my local traditional Chinese medicine store and I'll go I'm a little bit on the dumpy side and a little bit pale I don't think I could pass myself off as being ill also I think I would fail the first hurdle wouldn't ask questions now I could have run in there and said that hey I've got a stomach upset or I've got a slight headache and what-have-you and they probably would have sold me something but I really wanted to go after them selling stuff to seriously ill people so far okay I'm gonna make up a story I'm gonna say that I'm there on behalf of the loved one and that loved one happens to have cancer to see if they'll actually try and sell me anything and well believe or not they did now probably some of you thinking my goodness Myles you're looking particularly sexy to those classes today and I say thank you thank you I'm going for the whole geek chic look and I actually put these glasses up on one of my other videos so now I'm saying how what do you think of them surprisingly no one pointed out that they're actually a camera and it's got a 720 camera and the side of them here and I actually wore these when I went to my local store and for anyone who doesn't believe me here we go here's kind of my setup and there's me hello glasses [Applause] okay I'm just looking thanks look up what kind of stuff to do here all right Oh all right cool acupuncture the needles isn't it I'm not sure brother I know but I was thinking I know someone who is been well at the moment so I was wondering if this would be like any good or I don't know all right what kind of stuff occurs listings to like anxiety depression and acne I do well Christian she's like really know very well at the moment so was she I'm forcing she's got breast cancer I don't like Mikey oh no oh yeah oh really calicos 18 pounds who blonde it was it was happy to do can is reinsurance I can write this down no - okay take it sir they get like no today that's all right sorry no no the moment maybe I've got a bit more money so quarter sets and it's good pool okay cool all right well thank you very much a tee time alright see ya anyway back on I'm going to take these off because I think they do look a little bit Selena also her nose so I went to my local store and before I even entered the shop I was just outside I had someone come outside and asked me if they could help I told my lie about how I was looking to help a relative who had cancer and I was recommended that tea made from cordyceps for the price Li sum of eighteen pounds cordyceps our group of parasitic fungus --is they're actually the inspiration behind the zombie like creatures in the Last of Us after they infect their house they can in some cases change their behavior before killing them essentially using all their nutrients and then sprouting fruit out of various places and sometimes it's out of their head so then it can infect those in the vicinity it's it's really quite terrifying the species of course cept that's being sold here is I'm not gonna even try this here it is you know have a go pronouncing them now this quarter Sept infects a ghost month and the people who practice traditional Chinese medicine believe they can help with fatigue diabetes sexual function to name a few and also can help fight cancer the fungus was investigated to see if any of these claims had any basis in reality and it was discovered that this type of cordyceps may indeed have potential to be used in modern medicine research has shown that it has blood thinning properties and can reduce kidney toxicity from harsh medicines and surprisingly they've shown that this fungus does indeed have anti-cancer properties now the research was looking into this fungus were able to isolate the compound that they believed gave this a horrible monster its anti-cancer properties and that compound is called 3d oxy guanosine one proposed mechanism of action is that it can down regulate MHC class 2 antigen expression preventing the cell from evading immune response however 3d oxy guanosine is an adenosine derivative most enzymes can't tell the difference between the two so they lack use it now this becomes a real problem for example it can be incorporated into DNA but then once that happens it will basically stop extension after it's been incorporated and that can you know create a lot of damage in a cell this is the real danger about traditional Chinese medicine it's not that it's like any other kind of pseudo medical bullshit out there like homeopathy which essentially will do nothing you know some traditional Chinese medicine herbs and what have you actually have active ingredients and they will affect you these herbal remedies have well-documented herb-drug interactions and they can be harmful for people suffering from certain medical conditions for example cordyceps should not be taken if you're diabetic and using insulin but this was never mentioned to me in the store and this really should have been one of the first things to warn people about the potential side-effects but let's give these people the benefit of the doubt and say that you know what three deoxy guanosine is a really good anti-cancer drug should we then take traditional chinese medicine this one to help with your cancer no because you don't know the dosage you're taking there's also the problem of it's not pure this compound is hidden somewhere within a fungus and a caterpillar and you are ingesting a Bogert on other compounds that you don't know what effect they're gonna have on you so in summary stay away from traditional chinese medicine cure rules or remedies because the best case scenario they do nothing and they rob you of your money the worst-case scenario is they'll actually have an effect on you and they could make you even more sick now before I go I think it's only further I talk about the use of this footage in this video from these glasses here now I realize I could have made this video without including that footage and essentially it will be the same but I thought was really important for you guys to see for yourself this woman try and sell me this product and to not warn me about any potential dangers and basically to see someone selling I guess false hope rather expensive false hope 18 pounds that's rather expensive now I know this compound that they've isolated through York cigars even from this fungus does have anti-cancer properties but those anti-cancer properties are out of someone they're on the lab they're in a petri somewhere they don't work because it's not specific enough in a human so essentially it's not going to work it would just damage you I mean the st. James my co-host legal nerds keep saying is that you know what in the lab in a petri dish a gun is you know it has anti-cancer properties it's all about if it will work in a human and unfortunately this stuff just doesn't it can be incorporated into so many different things and it can damage a lot of processes see I just want to explain why I throw in there so to use our footage basically because I think it would have a greater impact than me just telling the story so anyway this is the end of this video let me know what you think let me know if you think I've went too far with these things I have actually another few videos lined up with these I went to get a card reading a tarot card reading using these and it was really interesting and the woman spent the majority of the time trying to pitch her profession to me I'd say you know you'd be a great card reader you know I can see in your energy no it's kind of jazz and she Britt did all this stuff about me and tried to guess my personality and she got it completely wrong and also I'm thinking it's quite insulting because she obviously did it from looking at me and trying to pick up things from me and what she said was quite like oh okay no that's not like me it also maybe I'm projecting the wrong kind of personality here anyway so I think that's for another video but let me know what you think and I also want a time to say thank you to all people help me like produce these videos through patreon you're having me buy shit like this and go places so I've got another mini series mini miniseries even of fact-checking march against Monsanto protesters coming up and that I think is gonna be pretty interesting because this time these people have some really quite good arguments and it's interesting getting to the bottom of them and finding out where they're from and I also managed to bump into Liz O'Neil I believe her name is who I was on the radio with a couple of months back and I got to talk to her so you guys you know we've got something to look forward to so anyway I'm gonna stop them Rumble mumbling rambling going on and I'll leave you guys to give me a thumbs up if you like this or a thumbs down if you don't like it whatever the jazz anyway so I will see you lovely people the Internet later boy",

            "transcript": "  in good shape your health magazine on DW featuring an interview with a different expert every week when you go to a doctor he sometimes need to take your pulse like this year I'm a GP myself and I know that different kind of pulses that can be slow and they can be fast but if I go to a traditional Chinese medicine doctor he knows about 28 different kinds of pulses hi mrs. Inga thanks for inviting me into your clinic you're a traditional doctor for Chinese medicine right and where do you find those pulses on both sides on the right on the left hand side and usually you find them if you do if you apply your fingertips on each side and you take actually three fingers on each side and each position the left position has like a superficial pass and then you go a little bit deeper and then you have a deep pass so there are three levels of of pulses and that's what you do on both sides interesting with the 28 to pass the qualities you just talked about is that you really find different past qualities on each patient so some patients ever very long pass so long pass goes up to here for example or some patients have a very deep pass so you really have to press out in order to find any quality of the pulse and then you can also find like a very pulse we call it it's a very tight quality of pulses so what do you know after he took the pulse after after the after taking the pulse and the time usually in combination I can ask often questions to confirm what I feel and then I can have an idea where the problem lies of the patient so the digests a problem or it has other issues if you take a look at the background or the medicinal Chinese medicine there it's it's a complete different system then like we use here in Germany in the European version of medicine and what are the differences first of all the language is different so usually when I want to talk about the liver and living in a new system it's a complete different idea to what I know the liver for Chinese doctor is not the organ we know which sits in the upper right abdominal area thank you so usually for us it's it's a functional I never has a certain function so when the liver doesn't work properly or the flow of the liver doesn't work properly patients might feel headache quite often often in stressful situations or fears of pressure in any civil case there are different suitors to one organ where we can define where the problem lies and do you use those Western diagnostic systems like Hydra sound or MRI scan we do especially again this clinic we work in a hospital here so we have possibilities to actually ask our colleagues to check certain patients that we're not sure about and we would like to have the support of listeners so it's a very integrative method then yeah and and the other way around does it work the other way around that your colleagues from the Western medicine refer patients to you is it a Chinese doctor that works as well especially for colleagues that suffer from pain and a to have a quicker result because they need to work again so that's why we they come here and we occupant said another techniques so so pain is one thing and and what whether they are the main diagnosis or analysis you'd like to treat treat internal medicine from digestive problems sleeping disorders emotional disorders is long there's a vast variety possibilities for Chinese medicine acupuncture treatment is perhaps the most well known therapy in Chinese medicine where do you find all those points on the body it's easy to find on each patient because each patient has similar landmarks so like no matter what I treat a child or a grown-up you cannot just measure that by certain landmarks bones muscle and then it's easy to find those 365 points how many points you treat at the same session and it depends really from one to twenty different points it really depends on the patient the condition can you show us how you treated us so what I use is them I use them acupuncture needle which we use only once very thin stainless steel needles and then I use a guide tube which makes it much easier for the insertion for the patient because I keep anxious pain-free and so you can just that's all it's all so how do you feel sir almost nothing so it's not that painful and what happens in the body after you insert the needle the insertion of the needle just regulates implement inflammation processes and also the circulation that in Chinese medicine we call it the flow of Chi in of blood that we stimulate with the acupuncture so Chi is the energy which is flown through it energy exactly so you try to to relieve certain blockages of the body by using the needles but there's even a Western point of view when it comes to acupuncture that there's some hormones and neurotransmitters are secreted after you you press with Annie Laurie exactly there are lots of different scientific researches but that has been done on acupuncture and you can see that the changes of hormones and even the blood results um some of my patients bring new blood results their changes throughout the treatment as well it's quite interesting okay acupuncture is one side of Chinese medicine the other side is herbal treatments and so what you do with this kind of treatment Herbert treatment is also important in order to treat certain conditions so we combine acupuncture herbal medicine and herbal medicine they are usually we use a combination of herbs usually between five to twenty five thank if I would have for example and osteoarthritis degenerative bone disease and there is no traditional Chinese doctor in my vicinity so I have no chance to go to a traditional Chinese doctor but I want to use these herbs can I go into a pharmacy and treat myself usually you need a certain prescription which it's it's very important to get a correct diagnosis in order to get a good result so what we usually do we have lots of international patients that come to us for a consultation and then if they live away far away we usually they take to the herbs for one or two months home and then they come back to us I got a lot of questions concerning traditional Chinese medicine one from Qatar Halima al Kumari wants to know if you can treat cancer with means of TCM we have many patients that come with cancer and they use therapies like chemotherapy and what we can do we can support the treatment by giving vans herbs acupuncture to reduce the side effects of chemotherapy so you don't heal the cancer but you can lessen the side-effects of the traditional thanks so much for inviting me into your clinic today thank you and thank you so much for demonstrating the architecture with us thank you",

Center for Chinese medicine outside rockville maryland inside a 2,000 square meter museum said to be the first of its kind in the country it's headed by TCM professor dr. bolli san eeja gababa and loaded onto I'll show our exhibitions are four people from educational and research institutes medical centers and everyday people we let them know the history culture and advantages of the museum is designed for Western visitors who may have heard about Chinese medicine but don't know much about it one interactive exhibit allows visitors to sit down with a statue of a traditional doctor from decades past who didn't use fancy tools sama oval ASEAN countries considering John flora a traditional doctor in the clinic had a table a chair and a small pillow to test the pulps patients would sit here and let in testicles across the way you can look at pickup touch and smell plants and herbs used in TCM disposition my phone this is my dog to help relieve dry mouth dry mouth is a symptom of weak lungs so this is good for lung help this part is the most important different ones are combined to create a special mix to best treat the patient's condition a traditional pharmacist wooden cabinet stores and organizes the herbs in a specific order Chinese medicine is based on the concept that our body is an organic whole comprised of two parts the tangible body and the intangible spirit or cheap and all over our body are more than 300 a key points that correspond to all of our internal organs so they correspond to different parts of the body and point if it had different policies here under there it is that's the concept behind another TCM practice acupuncture inserting five needles into the body at specific points to treat illness it's practiced at a clinic next door to the museum the hope is that both facilities will take the mystery out of TCM and help convince skeptics who dismiss TCM as non scientific putting try looking in a lot of my patients who are using Western treatments use one to two large jars of painkillers every year they have a lot of pain and their headache comes back a lot acupuncture killed their headache eventually by adjusting their body environment they don't need pain killers anymore we hope our traditional Chinese medicine can spread all over the world so more people can benefit from it Frances Cosi GTN Rockville Maryland",

What is it about those little needles that make them alleviate pain, treat illnesses and even help women to get pregnant?\r\n\r\nWhat is TEDx?\r\n\r\nIn the spirit of ideas worth spreading, TED has created a program called TEDx. TEDx is a program of local, self-organized events that bring people together to share a TED-like experience. Our event is called TEDxBratislava, where x = independently organized TED event. At our TEDxBratislava event, TEDTalks video and live speakers will combine to spark deep discussion and connection in a small group. The TED Conference provides general guidance for the TEDx program, but individual TEDx events, including ours, are self-organized.",

            "transcript": " Translator: salma farag Checker: Riyad Almubarak  Hello all.  Thank you very much for inviting me to Bratislava.  You know, it's a funny story.  You go back and forward to Vienna  And use the London-Bratislava line,  The trips took almost a week after another.  A very nice woman sat beside me  For what I told her it was my last trip to Bratislava.  And I said that with a little rest  Because, you know, flying is often very tiring.  And anyway, as the journey progresses -  We have two hours from London to Bratislava -  She said, \"Well, what are you doing?\"  I told her that I had been involved in Chinese medicine for 20 years.  So we talked, and you inked me,  Well, what do you think to return to Bratislava  And talk at TED about your experience? \"  So, you know, never make it hard; I'm here again,  Because, in fact, you have a beautiful city here  With a wonderful castle.  So, I'm grateful to be here, thank you.  (clap)  Anyway, I have rather an unusual job.  I, in the mid-1980s,  I decided instead to change my life and study Chinese medicine,  Which not many people in London are doing these days.  I've been able to learn Chinese medicine in London,  And I thought, \"Wonderful, what a wonderful system of medicine.\"  It comes from China.  About 3,000 years old,  It operates based on a completely different basis than Western medicine.  But there was little of me that was cynical  And I thought, \"Well, how does it work?\"  Because what happens here is that we are inserting needles into people's bodies  At different acupuncture points,  And suddenly they get better.  There is no scientific explanation  Of how this medical system actually works.  So I thought, \"It's time to go to China.\"  So in 1991, I went to China, to Nanjing,  I lived and worked in a busy traditional medicine hospital.  And this really changed my life,  Partly, you know, there was no small private room.  There was no, you know, comfortable, intimate conversation  About what happened when we were five or six years old or so,  And made us sick, perhaps, today.  You know, this was a system  Where hundreds and hundreds of people were coming to this busy hospital,  They were getting better.  What I saw was that things were very similar to shingles,  Very painful explosions on the body,  But surrounded by acupuncture needles gone within two or three days.  Things like facial paralysis, you know,  Very physical symptoms where half of the face is frozen,  And people are getting better.  So I had no doubt in my mind that Chinese medicine had something.  So I went back to the UK;  I went to practice, to set up my own clinic with colleagues,  And really, to some extent, it was a great experience in Britain.  We didn't really know what could be cured.  But people keep coming to us, and people are getting better.  And then it's hard to believe when I started all this,  Teaching acupuncture go to universities,  And to cut a long story short,  I find myself at the University of East London.  I'm the head of Chinese medicine there.  And I'm so happy to tell you,  I have one student from Bratislava that I hope will pass her exams this year.  So you will bring Chinese medicine back here.  So here we are, for me 20 years old I do it,  To date there is no scientific explanation of how this drug works.  And I want to tell you a short story about a patient  Let's give you some ideas about what acupuncture involves.  Let's call it Nadine.  She is thirty years old,  She and her husband  For two years trying to have a baby,  But it can not afford.  She goes for tests to her doctor, and tests reveal no problem:  \"You should be able to conceive.\"  So they continue to despair,  It has two courses of the so-called IVF, the concept of assistance,  They don't work.  So as a last resort, they come to me for acupuncture treatment.  And to be honest, you know, this is a big task,  You know, to give this woman a child, with needles.  (Laughter)  No, there is no play here.  So, anyway,  We diagnose and listen to her pulse.  I do all the things that Chinese doctors do,  We've been working together for five months,  And nothing happens - she does not carry.  And I started feeling uncomfortable  Because they pay money for treatment,  And one day I told her,  \"Look, I'm not sure this acupuncture is yours.\"  She looked at me and said,  \"You are like my mother:  You think I'm useless. You think I can't do this. \"  And you know, she was flowing out of anger,  And I said, \"You mean your mother doesn't think you can conceive?\"  \"No,\" she said.  She said, \"I'm so angry.\"  Now, in Chinese medicine,  Chinese has long been recognized  There is a connection between mind and physical function.  So on this particular occasion, I changed the acupuncture treatment.  And when I put the needles in,  There was a little electric shock that seemed different,  And this taking into account we've been working together five months.  And imagine what? I have loaded.  You know, there are many stories like this.  That's why, you know, the Chinese kept Chinese medicine.  And just, because I don't know how many people are here  Know what really be Chinese medicine,  But acupuncture is one remedy,  Herbal remedies, massage and movement are also available.  For example, in China, I visited Cancer Hospital,  They don't put their people down when they have cancer.  Keep them moving with things like qigong and taiji -  It's a different philosophy, a different way of thinking.  As you know, in China this drug has been used for 3000 years.  The idea is that the body is a network of meridians, or channels,  These channels seem to carry something called chi.  Now, there is no definition for Che.  There is no explanation you cannot measure.  There is no science explaining what Che is.  This of course makes people in the scientific establishment  Very very skeptical about what we do.  In China, there is no energy. It's not some primitive life force.  In fact, it gives meaning to things.  This conference today has a good chi.  You know, she has tremendous energy behind her.  Really gives purpose and meaning;  Creates life - this is the idea of \u200b\u200bChe.  Chinese medicine is really a system of clinical evidence  Based on a very different way of thinking about the body.  So, for example,  Emotions, in Chinese medicine, can cause disease.  So, as with the patient I told you about,  The idea that all this suppressed anger,  In fact, in Chinese medicine will have some convenience.  So Chinese medicine is a great success story.  I visited Cuba in my work  Because I heard it in Cuba  Chinese medicine was part of their integrated health care system.  And you know, when Cuba was isolated from the rest of the world  And they have no essential drugs,  They had to experience acupuncture.  They find it successful for things like strokes and heart attacks,  Now in Cuba today, you'll find two medical systems:  You'll find traditional medicine as well as contemporary Western medicine.  And I said in Cuba, to the president of the Cuban Acupuncture Association,  \"Why? Why acupuncture here?\"  He said, \"Because Chinese medicine is one of the best systems in the world,  One of the best medical systems,  We want one of the best medical systems for the Cuban people. \"  So, in Britain, you know, acupuncture is very popular.  But we, in the last two years,  You experience great hostility from the scientific establishment.  \"Where is your guide?\" They say.  \"You should just have a placebo\" You know, the idea of \u200b\u200bthe proposal.  Well, maybe, because placebo works in many medical systems,  But I think it's more.  I'm absolutely convinced that when you enter those needles,  Something going on.  We know some things now.  We know that acupuncture affects the limbic part of the brain.  We also know in the treatment of infertility  That's in the middle of the month if you acupuncture,  Increases blood flow to the uterus.  So we started to understand.  But at the same time, with all the hostility -  She is serious in Britain.  I mean, for example, there are people within the scientific establishment  Who want to close university courses like mine.  There are many books published saying, \"What is happening in Britain?  People suddenly start to believe in things that are irrational. \"  So, you know, these people ask good questions,  Because I particularly, as a teacher, have to ask myself, you know:  Well, did something happen here?  Or this is the medicine system, which is 3,000 years old,  Is it a good idea  Or something depends on, you know, on almost magic?  But I think Chinese medicine has two things  This western medicine does not have it.  The first is that Chinese medicine is a true art.  No practitioner needs to listen and consider.  They listen to the pulse. They listen to the patient's life -  The disease is not just an isolated group of symptoms.  It is our way of life, our history and what we want to do  Effect and can actually cause poor health.  It's a really innovative process almost an art form.  And know from art, only with the music that we heard before,  How this can actually create change makes us think differently.  The second thing for me about Chinese medicine,  Something really came across in China -  And you know what we did in the West  You made it very hierarchical, every important system of medicine  With language patients often do not understand.  It's often scary for patients. It is often gaseous.  But, you know, in China, a doctor told me,  \"You know, Charmian,  Here is actually a patient that is God and not a doctor. \"  And I found this over and over again,  This Chinese medicine tends to empower people;  Enable them to take much greater responsibility for their health,  I think this is what they offer.  So I just want to finish I'd like to show you a clip.  I prepared to visit China just before Christmas this year,  I was taken to a hospital in Shenyang, in northern China,  There is a doctor there  Who developed a technique to treat low back pain,  I would leave you with a quick clip.  It looks very exciting.  This is a very traditional treatment.  It's for lower back pain and sciatica.  Look over,  Even if you're in trouble,  I hope in Bratislava you will have a choice of having acupuncture.  (Video) Female voice: [this drug] originated from the northeastern part of China  Charmian: What kind of conditions? Only pain? Back pain in general?  Female: Yes Yes Yes.  Man: Wrinkles and shocks.  Man: You can see the fire along the channel.  Charmian: Yes, I can see it. It's wonderful.  Man: It's hot. Just feel it.  You can repeat the fire.  Female: And medicine can also be very good. ",

            "transcript": "  the color at a school of traditional Chinese medicine nestled at the foot of the majestic Rocky Mountains in Denver's historic Capitol Hill neighborhood is proud to offer two nationally accredited programs the Masters of Science degree in acupuncture and also the Masters of Science degree in traditional Chinese medicine where students learn herbal medicine as well our unique program blends the ancient wisdom of Chinese medicine including Tai Chi and Qigong Treena massage Gua Sha moxibustion fire cupping electro-stimulation and Chinese herbal medicine with a solid foundation in western biomedical sciences nutrition and business management I would just like to say to most people that if you're going to do oriental or Chinese medicine you need to find a practitioner that they does it with the traditional ways using the traditional needles the traditional copying the traditional herbs because you will get fantastic results because they have 4000 years of practice at this and experience and refining so it's much better than any other type of health care I've ever seen in the world traditional Chinese medicine is the world's oldest continually practiced professional medicine with its written history stretching back over 2,500 years and it's practice probably much older than that Chinese medicine treats the individual as a whole by restoring balance to the fundamental natural forces that affect our everyday lives as opposed to treating the disease using a common symptomatic approach I was always interested in acupuncture in Chinese medicine from about 20 years ago when I was in high school and I first had a interaction with it when I took a trip to China with our high school and didn't know anything about it growing up in Nebraska and then it just kind of came to me as almost a calling I had gone through to a pregnancy where I had acupuncture to help my first son turn from breech back to heads down and then during my second pregnancy and acupuncture done to help induce labor because he was late and it was successful and just decided then that it's something I really wanted to look into and be a part of and then when I found out the school is so close to my home made perfect sense so I applied that became a student our team of expert faculty teaches students both the theory and the practice behind this proven ancient medicine helping them apply it in their own lives as well as their patients our advance student clinic offers invaluable hands-on experience treating the needs of our local community students hone their skills with personal guidance from our expert clinical faculty who come to us from leading US and mainland Chinese universities all of our head clinical supervisors in the advanced student clinic have 10 years of experience or more I definitely think I would recommend CST cm to a perspective student and the reason going back to that foundational standard that gets set by the school always you know I always recommend this as people you know some young people come into the school of course yeah I went to school here I was a Dean here and I'm teaching here of course I would without any doubt with one of the country's largest herbal supply stores that is connected to a TCM school at their fingertips students can readily prepare powerful herbal formulations prescribed modern Pattin herbs and other Chinese remedies offering patients a holistic approach to health and well-being I love the Herbal pharmacy that's so cool having access to all of those different lines of products is unbelievable at my old school we just had granules which is awesome and then raw herbs but so many people are even like I can't take those when it comes to the granules so having access to all the different patents is pretty phenomenal and because they're cheaper people like that so yeah kind of the world we live in where it's easier to pop a pill and like boil herbs every day so I love access to that it's fun it's easy learn from our library has over 8,000 English and Chinese language books journals and periodicals covering traditional Chinese medicine Western medicine and alternative medicine in addition there are media resources available in various formats covering the same subjects and various Anatomy models to assist students in their studies and meet the information needs of faculty students and patients in addition the library and classrooms offer high-speed wireless internet access SIA is amazing because some even just one needle and even just use some look or find some herb and can quickly review the symptom so he's amazing we care about every one of our students their success in school and their TCM practice to follow in addition to our clinic library and herbal store our facilities offer large open classrooms a student lounge and house a variety of resident practitioners the Massage Therapy Institute of Colorado and the luxurious ease bus spa I think the best attribute actually is the commitment the school and the founders of the school have had to to the medicine since they started and it's indoor like it's the school's new it was 25 years old and that commitment to the medicine and producing quality highly trained practitioners as the glass their commitment is really shows I think it's the best attribute yeah because of the commitment to the medicine the school has always had a strong bull program which I think it could be commended for and I know now that students have an option to do the acupuncture on me degree and then finish the TCM degree after they've got out and start practising acupuncture which i think is a benefit because they can get out and start seeing patients start actually working in the field and then come in and finish off the herbal training and be a stronger practitioner for us to break away and enjoy Colorado's glorious weather students often utilize our rooftop deck as they relax study and practice community in Tai Chi and Qigong and just footsteps or a bike ride away students will find a variety of restaurants shops art galleries several city parks several museums the Denver Botanic Gardens and the Denver Zoo Denver has ample employment and housing opportunities and offers a unique combination of city culture within close proximity to abundant nature well certainly Denver is one of the most diverse cities in the nation very integrated lots of different people lots of opportunity here the city is growing and CBS TCM is like right in the heart of this new Denver that has been emerging over the last I'd say decade since its foundation in 1989 our administration have remained committed to making this extensive TCM program accessible to any student truly devoted to learning the art of healing we are more affordable than comparable programs around the country while offering as much or even more advanced training CST cm works hard to offer supportive educational atmosphere we make every effort to assist students in obtaining educational funding we are certified by the US Department of Education to participate in the title for student aid programs including Stafford grad plus and alternative student loans additionally we are approved for various Colorado State vocational rehabilitation programs and Veterans Affairs Rehabilitation and educational benefits and as apposed 9/11 GI Bill we accept new students three times per year trimesters begin in January early May and late August students may enroll with as few as 60 college credits we have either day or evening classes to choose from but I think that this medicine is inherently self loving and you know you really are taught to take care of yourself as well as others so I really just try to apply the medicine to myself as much as possible and yes sleep and eat good foods and you know rest when I can and just find time to do peaceful things so that my brain can take a break but our program is not for everyone it will challenge you not only to become a great healer but indeed a greater person our graduates are in their respect through hard work dedication professionalism and continuous personal growth when we finally give a graduate their diploma per se in the community now as we do that they are not simply trained in Chinese medicine but are in fact a true healer capable of making a real difference in today's world yeah excellent teachers I really appreciate the variety and very the varying styles of the different practitioners that come from different areas of the tradition I think that is enriched the experience significantly because we're getting so many different points of view sometimes it's a lot to take in but once you digest it we can approach it from so many different angles I think that that's great with the faculty also and with the clinic I just started the clinic this semester it's been a great I've been paired with a great team and they're very helpful and enabling me and the other students that are on my same level to move forward and to grow and apply what you know what we've learned our school brings together unique diversity of students faculty and staff devoted to living and promoting healthier holistic lifestyles it's a community full of life art and culture join us at our annual Chinese New Year celebration one of our summer barbecues or bowling parties and you'll see just how special and beautiful this is in the words of Lao Tzu the journey of a thousand miles begins with the first step and we invite you to take the

This time, I will explain why you have acne from a traditional Chinese medicine point of view and based on ancient Chinese principles and beliefs.

            "title": "How To Treat Acne The Traditional Chinese Way",
            "transcript": "  hello my beauties as you have followed me for a while now you know I have been talking about acne for years and you probably have seen a ton of acne videos on YouTube land from how to prevent acne how to cure acne how to deal with acne scarring or different types of acne and the list goes on so this is not going to be one of those videos in fact it's not going to be a video that tells you do this and it's going to kill your acne right away that doesn't not happen now I'd like to share with you some really important knowledge on how traditional Chinese medicine view acne and what's happening on the inside of your body and what you can do to old balance and regulate that properly so as you have already heard me mentioned before the body the universe and everything in between is made up of being and yang and that's what the traditional Chinese medicine talks about quite often that we need that balance and that harmony of both yin and yang so first of all I would like to reiterate that the Chinese traditional medicine view that acting on your face correlates to certain organs and different parts of your body and there that therefore telling you what you should be focusing on secondly Chinese traditional medicine also believed that there is a flow of energy which we call cheats that flows through our body there circulates through these passageways and Meriden if there is any type of blockage in those passageways it can also cause certain problems for body less than at least you also hear traditional Chinese medicine talk about being and game talk about heat hold excess efficiency interior/exterior and addition to that there is also the five elements which is Jing Wu Shan or - this is just all about harmony and balance and how we can regulate that to create the best environments and also the best possible self that you can be the most common belief is that the skin is controlled by the lungs and when you have acne and things that that occur on the surface layer of your skin it is often because of excessive heat in the lung and you want to make sure you dig toxify and get rid of anything that's bad in those areas as well as intestines and on the bus of course the first thing we talk about is the foods that we should be eating so in order to get rid of excess heat we have to eat foods us consider cold and in this case foods that are more in so you have foods such as cabbage lettuce bitter melon cucumbers watermelon winter melon celery pears persimmons and long beans of course at the same time you also have to avoid foods that are too spicy or deep-fried salty process dairy products you have to actually take out the excess heat out of your body by stop doing what's causing the heat and adding the more cooling things there are also two pressure points that you could be doing every day and you can just do this for that one to two minutes a day corpora into a daily life and that will not only help to detox but also clear out the lungs and intestines to basically allow EG or the energy in your body to pass through these passageways more freely and eventually help clear your skin the very first pressure point is actually located on your arm so if you place your right hand on the left side of your chest and then as you can see the crease in your elbow at the end of that crease is where the pressure point is and then you just apply some water pressure on you hold this down for a minute and you repeat this on the other side and basically spend about ten minutes doing this pressure point daily this is known to clear any heat or toxins from the body especially from your lungs and your test time now the second pressure point is actually on your feet and the web of your feet between the second and the third toed right in that sort of dent in between is where the pressure point is if you want to hold down with either your index finger or your thumb apply so I'm not a pressure but not too hard to hold that down for three or five minutes and you can do this at the same time with both feet while watching TV or this YouTube video or before you go to bed last but not least is a tip that I find my most useful this is something that I have noticed drastically in my life you might not realize this but the number one cause for any type of problems whether it's your skin or your health or even like the way you have this or the way things happen in your life is so dependent on the mood the aura that you have but at the same time the mindset if you're stressed and if you're always unhappy if you're always angry basically and to not only attract negative energy but attract negative things that might happen to you so in order to clear your mind in order to center yourself in order to be positive the most effective way is to meditate the meditation is something that is probably foreign to a lot of people that is actually quite common and also very useful it is not just used in Chinese practices but actually used route other places like I've known so many people who are either in the workforce or at school or some people who like work in real estate that I know that do this and they find has made such a huge difference to their life not only in their business but also in their personal life and I feel like that is something that I really want to stress out to you guys so meditating even just five to ten minutes a day can change everything for you just sit in a lotus position you want to block out anything that's negative any issues that you might have at work or have it home or anything makes you unhappy and all you need to do is think about nothing just clear your mind of anything that unwanted you'll just realize sometimes that farmers will go past so quickly it becomes ten minutes sometimes even half an hour to an hour that precious moment when you just with your thoughts and when you clear out everything I wanted your mind becomes so much clearer you have a better mood for the day you see things differently and sometimes the problems that you might have will just solve itself and it's just amazing what it can do for you you even feel more revitalize you feel in a happier mood and when you're happy and positive you would definitely attract more happy positive things that's the same thing with the skin because you're so stressed about how your skin looks and how affect you that it was just building on that negativity where if you clear your mind and you're not thinking about it sometimes it will actually go away on itself and it's just how your body works what i really suggest is try and incorporate these simple tips into your daily life and you will notice a huge on a sidenote youtube change the notification system so maybe some of you
